val download : prog:string -> t -> ?template:(string*string*int) -> ?progress_bar:bool -> ?proxy:proxy_mode -> uri -> (filename * bool)
(** Download the URI, returning the downloaded filename and a
    temporary file flag.  The temporary file flag is [true] iff
    the downloaded file is temporary and should be deleted by the
    caller (otherwise it's in the cache and you shouldn't delete it).

    For templates, you must supply [~template:(name, arch, revision)].
    This causes the cache to be used (if possible).  Name, arch(itecture)
    and revision are used for cache control (see the man page for details).

    If [~progress_bar:true] then display a progress bar if the file
    doesn't come from the cache.  In verbose mode, progress messages
    are always displayed.

    [proxy] specifies the type of proxy to be used in the transfer,
    if possible. *)
