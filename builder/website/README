If you are looking at this file at http://libguestfs.org/download/builder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory is used by the libguestfs 'virt-builder' to store the
clean, signed OS templates used for building new virtual machines.

The index file is the default source URL and links to the other OS
templates.  It has the canonical URL:

  http://libguestfs.org/download/builder/index.asc

If you are looking at this file in the git repository
-----------------------------------------------------

libguestfs.git/builder/website/ contains a copy of the website, minus
the huge OS template files (because of their size, they are stored
elsewhere and merged into the website when it is uploaded).

When you use the ./run script to run virt-builder without installing,
the ./run script sets $VIRT_BUILDER_SOURCE to point to this directory.
If you actually want to use this configuration for anything except
simple testing, you will have to download one or more OS templates
from the libguestfs website and put them into the builder/website/
directory.

ie:

  ./run virt-builder fedora-20

will fail unless you have downloaded fedora-20.xz here.

The general plan for using kickstart and virt-install is outlined
by Kashyap here:

http://kashyapc.wordpress.com/2011/08/18/unattended-guest-install-with-a-local-kickstart/

If you want to reproduce the builds then the kickstart files are
located in fedora-<N>.ks and the virt-install + other commands are in
fedora-<N>.sh.
