Sys::Guestfs
------------

This directory contains the Perl bindings for the libguestfs API.

The basic libguestfs bindings have the name 'Sys::Guestfs'.

As with all other language bindings, these bindings are generated
automatically.  See generator/ directory.

Sys::Guestfs::Lib
-----------------

Because we use Perl for writing lots of additional tools around
libguestfs, the Perl bindings also contain an extra library of useful
functions, called 'Sys::Guestfs::Lib'.  This extra library is entirely
optional, and only enhances the usefulness of the ordinary libguestfs
API.

One of the features of this library is tighter libvirt integration.
