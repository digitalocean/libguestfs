This directory contains various example programs which use the perl
Sys::Guestfs bindings to the libguestfs API.

As they are examples, these are licensed so they can be freely copied
and used without any restrictions.

Tips:

(1) To enable verbose messages, set environment variable LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1

(2) To run a program without installing the library, set PERL5LIB and
LIBGUESTFS_PATH as in this example (if run from the root directory of
the source distribution):

  LIBGUESTFS_PATH=$(pwd)/appliance \
  PERL5LIB=$(pwd)/perl/blib/lib:$(pwd)/perl/blib/arch/auto/Sys/Guestfs \
  perl/examples/foo
