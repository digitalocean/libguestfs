guestfs-java - How to use libguestfs from Java

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 import com.redhat.et.libguestfs.*;
 
 GuestFS g = new GuestFS ();
 g.add_drive ("disk.img",
              new HashMap<String,Object>() {
                {
                    put ("readonly", Boolean.TRUE);
                    put ("format", "raw");
                }
              });
 g.launch ();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to call libguestfs from the Java
programming language.  This page just documents the differences from
the C API and gives some examples.  If you are not familiar with using
libguestfs, you also need to read L<guestfs(3)>.

=head2 CLOSING THE HANDLE

The handle is closed when it is reaped by the garbage collector.
Because libguestfs handles include a lot of state, it is also
possible to close (and hence free) them explicitly by calling
the C<close> method.

=head2 EXCEPTIONS

Errors from libguestfs functions are mapped into the
C<LibGuestFSException> exception.  This has a single parameter which
is the error message (a C<String>).

Calling any method on a closed handle raises the same exception.

=head2 EVENTS

The L<libguestfs event API|guestfs(3)/EVENTS> is fully supported from
Java.  Create a class which implements the C<EventCallback> interface,
create an instance of this class, and then call the C<GuestFS#set_event_callback>
method to register this instance.  The C<event> method of the class is
called when libguestfs generates an event.

For example, this will print all trace events:

 GuestFS g = new GuestFS ();
 g.set_trace (true);
 g.set_event_callback (
   new EventCallback () {
     public void event (long event, int eh,
                        String buffer, long[] array) {
       System.out.println (GuestFS.eventToString (event) +
                           ": " + buffer);
     }
   },
   GuestFS.EVENT_TRACE);
 g.add_drive_ro ("disk.img");
 // etc.

The output looks similar to this:

 EVENT_TRACE: add_drive_ro "disk.img"
 EVENT_TRACE: add_drive_ro = 0
 // etc.
