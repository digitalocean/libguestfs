"""Python bindings for libguestfs

import guestfs
g = guestfs.GuestFS (python_return_dict=True)
g.add_drive_opts ("guest.img", format="raw")
g.launch ()
parts = g.list_partitions ()

The guestfs module provides a Python binding to the libguestfs API
for examining and modifying virtual machine disk images.

Amongst the things this is good for: making batch configuration
changes to guests, getting disk used/free statistics (see also:
virt-df), migrating between virtualization systems (see also:
virt-p2v), performing partial backups, performing partial guest
clones, cloning guests and changing registry/UUID/hostname info, and
much else besides.

Libguestfs uses Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of
guest filesystem that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited
to: ext2/3/4, btrfs, FAT and NTFS, LVM, many different disk partition
schemes, qcow, qcow2, vmdk.

Libguestfs provides ways to enumerate guest storage (eg. partitions,
LVs, what filesystem is in each LV, etc.).  It can also run commands
in the context of the guest.  Also you can access filesystems over
FUSE.

Errors which happen while using the API are turned into Python
RuntimeError exceptions.

To create a guestfs handle you usually have to perform the following
sequence of calls:

# Create the handle, call add_drive* at least once, and possibly
# several times if the guest has multiple block devices:
g = guestfs.GuestFS ()
g.add_drive_opts ("guest.img", format="raw")

# Launch the qemu subprocess and wait for it to become ready:
g.launch ()

# Now you can issue commands, for example:
logvols = g.lvs ()

        each one.
        
        The number of disks added is returned. This operation is
        atomic: if an error is returned, then no disks are
        added.
        
        This function does some minimal checks to make sure the
        libvirt domain is not running (unless "readonly" is
        true). In a future version we will try to acquire the
        libvirt lock on each disk.
        
        Disks must be accessible locally. This often means that
        adding disks from a remote libvirt connection (see
        <http://libvirt.org/remote.html>) will fail unless those
        disks are accessible via the same device path locally
        too.
        
        The optional "libvirturi" parameter sets the libvirt URI
        (see <http://libvirt.org/uri.html>). If this is not set
        then we connect to the default libvirt URI (or one set
        through an environment variable, see the libvirt
        documentation for full details).

        try to connect to a running virtual machine "guestfsd"
        process if it sees a suitable <channel> element in the
        libvirt XML definition. The default (if the flag is
        omitted) is never to try. See "ATTACHING TO RUNNING
        DAEMONS" in guestfs(3) for more information.
        
        If the "allowuuid" flag is true (default is false) then
        a UUID *may* be passed instead of the domain name. The
        "dom" string is treated as a UUID first and looked up,
        and if that lookup fails then we treat "dom" as a name
        as usual.
        
        The optional "readonlydisk" parameter controls what we
        do for disks which are marked <readonly/> in the libvirt
        XML. Possible values are:
        
        readonlydisk = "error"
        If "readonly" is false:
        
        The whole call is aborted with an error if any disk

        Disks with the <readonly/> flag are added read-only.

        When this function is called before "g.launch" (the
        usual case) then the first time you call this function,
        the disk appears in the API as /dev/sda, the second time
        as /dev/sdb, and so on.
        
        In libguestfs ≥ 1.20 you can also call this function
        after launch (with some restrictions). This is called
        "hotplugging". When hotplugging, you must specify a
        "label" so that the new disk gets a predictable name.
        For more information see "HOTPLUGGING" in guestfs(3).
        
        You don't necessarily need to be root when using
        libguestfs. However you obviously do need sufficient
        permissions to access the filename for whatever
        operations you want to perform (ie. read access if you
        just want to read the image or write access if you want
        to modify the image).
        
        This call checks that filename exists.
        
        filename may be the special string "/dev/null". See
        "NULL DISKS" in guestfs(3).
        
        The optional arguments are:
        
        "readonly"
        If true then the image is treated as read-only.
        Writes are still allowed, but they are stored in a
        temporary snapshot overlay which is discarded at the
        end. The disk that you add is not modified.
        
        "format"
        This forces the image format. If you omit this (or
        use "g.add_drive" or "g.add_drive_ro") then the
        format is automatically detected. Possible formats
        include "raw" and "qcow2".
        
        Automatic detection of the format opens you up to a
        potential security hole when dealing with untrusted
        raw-format images. See CVE-2010-3851 and
        RHBZ#642934. Specifying the format closes this
        security hole.
        
        "iface"
        This rarely-used option lets you emulate the
        behaviour of the deprecated "g.add_drive_with_if"
        call (q.v.)
        
        "name"
        The name the drive had in the original guest, e.g.
        /dev/sdb. This is used as a hint to the guest
        inspection process if it is available.
        
        "label"
        Give the disk a label. The label should be a unique,
        short string using *only* ASCII characters
        "[a-zA-Z]". As well as its usual name in the API
        (such as /dev/sda), the drive will also be named
        /dev/disk/guestfs/*label*.
        
        See "DISK LABELS" in guestfs(3).
        
        "protocol"

        "server"
        For protocols which require access to a remote
        server, this is a list of server(s).
        
        Protocol       Number of servers required
        --------       --------------------------

        sheepdog       Zero or more
        ssh            Exactly one
        
        Each list element is a string specifying a server.
        The string must be in one of the following formats:
        
        hostname
        hostname:port
        tcp:hostname
        tcp:hostname:port
        unix:/path/to/socket
        
        If the port number is omitted, then the standard
        port number for the protocol is used (see
        /etc/services).
        
        "username"
        For the "ftp", "ftps", "http", "https", "iscsi",
        "rbd", "ssh" and "tftp" protocols, this specifies
        the remote username.
        
        If not given, then the local username is used for
        "ssh", and no authentication is attempted for ceph.
        But note this sometimes may give unexpected results,
        for example if using the libvirt backend and if the
        libvirt backend is configured to start the qemu
        appliance as a special user such as "qemu.qemu". If
        in doubt, specify the remote username you want.
        
        "secret"
        For the "rbd" protocol only, this specifies the
        'secret' to use when connecting to the remote
        device. It must be base64 encoded.
        
        If not given, then a secret matching the given
        username will be looked up in the default keychain
        locations, or if no username is given, then no
        authentication will be used.
        
        "cachemode"
        Choose whether or not libguestfs will obey sync
        operations (safe but slow) or not (unsafe but fast).
        The possible values for this string are:
        
        "cachemode = "writeback""
        This is the default.
        
        Write operations in the API do not return until
        a write(2) call has completed in the host [but
        note this does not imply that anything gets
        written to disk].
        
        Sync operations in the API, including implicit
        syncs caused by filesystem journalling, will not
        return until an fdatasync(2) call has completed
        in the host, indicating that data has been
        committed to disk.
        
        "cachemode = "unsafe""
        In this mode, there are no guarantees.
        Libguestfs may cache anything and ignore sync
        requests. This is suitable only for scratch or
        temporary disks.
        
        "discard"
        Enable or disable discard (a.k.a. trim or unmap)
        support on this drive. If enabled, operations such
        as "g.fstrim" will be able to discard / make thin /
        punch holes in the underlying host file or device.
        
        Possible discard settings are:
        
        "discard = "disable""
        Disable discard support. This is the default.
        
        "discard = "enable""
        Enable discard support. Fail if discard is not
        possible.
        
        "discard = "besteffort""
        Enable discard support if possible, but don't
        fail if it is not supported.
        
        Since not all backends and not all underlying
        systems support discard, this is a good choice
        if you want to use discard if possible, but
        don't mind if it doesn't work.
        
        "copyonread"
        The boolean parameter "copyonread" enables
        copy-on-read support. This only affects disk formats
        which have backing files, and causes reads to be
        stored in the overlay layer, speeding up multiple
        reads of the same area of disk.
        
        The default is false.

        *   The PNG image returned can be any size. It might not

        These calls are *only* necessary in some very limited
        circumstances, mainly the case where you want to mount a
        mix of unrelated and/or read-only filesystems together.
        
        For example, live CDs often contain a "Russian doll"
        nest of filesystems, an ISO outer layer, with a squashfs
        image inside, with an ext2/3 image inside that. You can

        mountpoint.
        
        "g.mkmountpoint" is not compatible with "g.umount_all".
        You may get unexpected errors if you try to mix these
        calls. It is safest to manually unmount filesystems and
        remove mountpoints after use.
        
        "g.umount_all" unmounts filesystems by sorting the paths
        longest first, so for this to work for manual
        mountpoints, you must ensure that the innermost
        mountpoints have the longest pathnames, as in the
        example code above.

        Autosync [see "g.set_autosync", this is set by default
