"""Python bindings for libguestfs

import guestfs
g = guestfs.GuestFS ()
g.add_drive_opts ("guest.img", format="raw")
g.launch ()
parts = g.list_partitions ()

The guestfs module provides a Python binding to the libguestfs API
for examining and modifying virtual machine disk images.

Amongst the things this is good for: making batch configuration
changes to guests, getting disk used/free statistics (see also:
virt-df), migrating between virtualization systems (see also:
virt-p2v), performing partial backups, performing partial guest
clones, cloning guests and changing registry/UUID/hostname info, and
much else besides.

Libguestfs uses Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of
guest filesystem that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited
to: ext2/3/4, btrfs, FAT and NTFS, LVM, many different disk partition
schemes, qcow, qcow2, vmdk.

Libguestfs provides ways to enumerate guest storage (eg. partitions,
LVs, what filesystem is in each LV, etc.).  It can also run commands
in the context of the guest.  Also you can access filesystems over
FUSE.

Errors which happen while using the API are turned into Python
RuntimeError exceptions.

To create a guestfs handle you usually have to perform the following
sequence of calls:

# Create the handle, call add_drive* at least once, and possibly
# several times if the guest has multiple block devices:
g = guestfs.GuestFS ()
g.add_drive_opts ("guest.img", format="raw")

# Launch the qemu subprocess and wait for it to become ready:
g.launch ()

# Now you can issue commands, for example:
logvols = g.lvs ()

        time as "/dev/sdb", and so on.
        
        You don't necessarily need to be root when using
        libguestfs. However you obviously do need sufficient
        permissions to access the filename for whatever
        operations you want to perform (ie. read access if you
        just want to read the image or write access if you want
        to modify the image).
        
        This call checks that "filename" exists.
        
        The optional arguments are:
        
        "readonly"
        If true then the image is treated as read-only.
        Writes are still allowed, but they are stored in a
        temporary snapshot overlay which is discarded at the
        end. The disk that you add is not modified.
        
        "format"
        This forces the image format. If you omit this (or
        use "g.add_drive" or "g.add_drive_ro") then the
        format is automatically detected. Possible formats
        include "raw" and "qcow2".
        
        Automatic detection of the format opens you up to a
        potential security hole when dealing with untrusted
        raw-format images. See CVE-2010-3851 and
        RHBZ#642934. Specifying the format closes this
        security hole.
        
        "iface"
        This rarely-used option lets you emulate the
        behaviour of the deprecated "g.add_drive_with_if"
        call (q.v.)
        
        "name"
        The name the drive had in the original guest, e.g.
        /dev/sdb. This is used as a hint to the guest
        inspection process if it is available.

        The optional "libvirturi" parameter sets the libvirt URI
        (see <http://libvirt.org/uri.html>). If this is not set

        If the "allowuuid" flag is true (default is false) then
        a UUID *may* be passed instead of the domain name. The

        and if that lookup fails then we treat "dom" as a name
        as usual.

        If finding the favicon fails, then we look in other
        places in the guest for a suitable icon.
        
        If the optional "highquality" boolean is true then only
        high quality icons are returned, which means only icons
        of high resolution with an alpha channel. The default
        (false) is to return any icon we can, even if it is of
        substandard quality.
        
        Notes:
        
        *   Unlike most other inspection API calls, the guest's
        disks must be mounted up before you call this, since
        it needs to read information from the guest
        filesystem during the call.
        
        *   Security: The icon data comes from the untrusted
        guest, and should be treated with caution. PNG files
        have been known to contain exploits. Ensure that
        libpng (or other relevant libraries) are fully up to
        date before trying to process or display the icon.
        
        *   The PNG image returned can be any size. It might not
        be square. Libguestfs tries to return the largest,
        highest quality icon available. The application must
        scale the icon to the required size.
        
        *   Extracting icons from Windows guests requires the
        external "wrestool" program from the "icoutils"
        package, and several programs ("bmptopnm",
        "pnmtopng", "pamcut") from the "netpbm" package.
        These must be installed separately.
        
        *   Operating system icons are usually trademarks. Seek
        legal advice before using trademarks in
        applications.

        mkmountpoint /cd

        mount-loop /sqsh/LiveOS/ext3fs.img /ext3fs
        
        The inner filesystem is now unpacked under the /ext3fs
        mountpoint.
        
        "g.mkmountpoint" is not compatible with "g.umount_all".
        You may get unexpected errors if you try to mix these
        calls. It is safest to manually unmount filesystems and
        remove mountpoints after use.
        
        "g.umount_all" unmounts filesystems by sorting the paths
        longest first, so for this to work for manual
        mountpoints, you must ensure that the innermost
        mountpoints have the longest pathnames, as in the
        example code above.

        option.

        is checked by e2fsck(8). If this is 0 then the
        number of mounts is disregarded. This is the same as

        mounted. This is the same as the tune2fs "-C"
        option.
        
        "errorbehavior"
        Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors
        are detected. Possible values currently are:
        "continue", "remount-ro", "panic". In practice these
        options don't really make any difference,
        particularly for write errors.
        
        This is the same as the tune2fs "-e" option.
        
        "group"
        Set the group which can use reserved filesystem
        blocks. This is the same as the tune2fs "-g" option
        except that it can only be specified as a number.
        
        "intervalbetweenchecks"
        Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem
        checks (in seconds). If the option is passed as 0
        then time-dependent checking is disabled.
        
        This is the same as the tune2fs "-i" option.
        
        "reservedblockspercentage"
        Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only
        be allocated by privileged processes. This is the
        same as the tune2fs "-m" option.
        
        "lastmounteddirectory"
        Set the last mounted directory. This is the same as
        the tune2fs "-M" option.
        
        "reservedblockscount" Set the number of reserved
        filesystem blocks. This is the same as the tune2fs "-r"
        option.
        "user"
        Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem
        blocks. This is the same as the tune2fs "-u" option
