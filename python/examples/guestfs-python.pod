=head1 NAME

guestfs-python - How to use libguestfs from Python

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 import guestfs
 g = guestfs.GuestFS (python_return_dict=True)
 g.add_drive_opts ("disk.img", format="raw", readonly=1)
 g.launch ()

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to call libguestfs from the Python
programming language.  This page just documents the differences from
the C API and gives some examples.  If you are not familiar with using
libguestfs, you also need to read L<guestfs(3)>.

=head2 python_return_dict=True

All new code should construct the handle using:

 g = guestfs.GuestFS (python_return_dict=True)

This indicates that your program wants to receive Python dicts for
methods in the API that return hashtables.

In a future version of libguestfs, this will become the default.

=head2 EXCEPTIONS

Errors from libguestfs functions are mapped into C<RuntimeException>
with a single string argument which is the error message.

=head2 MORE DOCUMENTATION

Type:

 $ python
 >>> import guestfs
 >>> help (guestfs)
