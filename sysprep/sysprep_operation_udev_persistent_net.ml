Remove udev persistent net rules which map the guestâ€™s existing MAC
address to a fixed ethernet device (eg. eth0).

After a guest is cloned, the MAC address usually changes.  Since the
old MAC address occupies the old name (eg. eth0), this means the fresh
MAC address is assigned to a new name (eg. eth1) and this is usually
undesirable.  Erasing the udev persistent net rules avoids this.");
