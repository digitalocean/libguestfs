This directory contains various example programs which use the OCaml
Guestfs bindings to the libguestfs API.

As they are examples, these are licensed so they can be freely copied
and used without any restrictions.

Note that 'viewer' needs some OCaml packages which aren't checked for
by default by the ./configure script.  Read the comments at the top of
the source for more details.

Tips:

(1) To enable verbose messages, set environment variable LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1
