val add_firstboot_script : prog:string -> Guestfs.guestfs -> string -> int -> string -> unit
  (** [add_firstboot_script ~prog g root idx content] adds a firstboot
      script called [shortname] containing [content].

      NB. [content] is the contents of the script, {b not} a filename.

      The scripts run in index ([idx]) order.

      For Linux guests using SELinux you should make sure the
      filesystem is relabelled after calling this. *)
