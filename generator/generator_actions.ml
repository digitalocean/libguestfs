The PNG image returned can be any size.  It might not be square.
Libguestfs tries to return the largest, highest quality
icon available.  The application must scale the icon to the
required size.

C<guestfs_mkmountpoint> and C<guestfs_rmmountpoint> are
specialized calls that can be used to create extra mountpoints
before mounting the first filesystem.

These calls are I<only> necessary in some very limited circumstances,
mainly the case where you want to mount a mix of unrelated and/or
read-only filesystems together.

For example, live CDs often contain a \"Russian doll\" nest of
filesystems, an ISO outer layer, with a squashfs image inside, with
an ext2/3 image inside that.  You can unpack this as follows
in guestfish:

 add-ro Fedora-11-i686-Live.iso
 run
 mkmountpoint /cd
 mkmountpoint /sqsh
 mkmountpoint /ext3fs
 mount /dev/sda /cd
 mount-loop /cd/LiveOS/squashfs.img /sqsh
 mount-loop /sqsh/LiveOS/ext3fs.img /ext3fs

The inner filesystem is now unpacked under the /ext3fs mountpoint.

C<guestfs_mkmountpoint> is not compatible with C<guestfs_umount_all>.
You may get unexpected errors if you try to mix these calls.  It is
safest to manually unmount filesystems and remove mountpoints after use.

C<guestfs_umount_all> unmounts filesystems by sorting the paths
longest first, so for this to work for manual mountpoints, you
must ensure that the innermost mountpoints have the longest
pathnames, as in the example code above.

For more details see L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=599503>

This command creates a new inotify handle.
The inotify subsystem can be used to notify events which happen to
objects in the guest filesystem.

C<maxevents> is the maximum number of events which will be
queued up between calls to C<guestfs_inotify_read> or
C<guestfs_inotify_files>.
If this is passed as C<0>, then the kernel (or previously set)
default is used.  For Linux 2.6.29 the default was 16384 events.
Beyond this limit, the kernel throws away events, but records
the fact that it threw them away by setting a flag
C<IN_Q_OVERFLOW> in the returned structure list (see
C<guestfs_inotify_read>).

Before any events are generated, you have to add some
watches to the internal watch list.  See: C<guestfs_inotify_add_watch> and
C<guestfs_inotify_rm_watch>.

Queued up events should be read periodically by calling
C<guestfs_inotify_read>
(or C<guestfs_inotify_files> which is just a helpful
wrapper around C<guestfs_inotify_read>).  If you don't
read the events out often enough then you risk the internal
queue overflowing.

The handle should be closed after use by calling
C<guestfs_inotify_close>.  This also removes any
watches automatically.

See also L<inotify(7)> for an overview of the inotify interface
as exposed by the Linux kernel, which is roughly what we expose
via libguestfs.  Note that there is one global inotify handle

This can be used to resolve case insensitive paths on
a filesystem which is case sensitive.  The use case is
to resolve paths which you have read from Windows configuration
files or the Windows Registry, to the true path.

The command handles a peculiarity of the Linux ntfs-3g
filesystem driver (and probably others), which is that although
the underlying filesystem is case-insensitive, the driver
exports the filesystem to Linux as case-sensitive.

One consequence of this is that special directories such
as C<c:\\windows> may appear as C</WINDOWS> or C</windows>
(or other things) depending on the precise details of how
they were created.  In Windows itself this would not be
a problem.

Bug or feature?  You decide:
L<http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/#posixfilenames1>

This function resolves the true case of each element in the
path and returns the case-sensitive path.

Thus C<guestfs_case_sensitive_path> (\"/Windows/System32\")
might return C<\"/WINDOWS/system32\"> (the exact return value

=item B<gpt>

Intel EFI / GPT partition table.

This is recommended for >= 2 TB partitions that will be accessed
from Linux and Intel-based Mac OS X.  It also has limited backwards
compatibility with the C<mbr> format.

=item B<mbr>

=item B<msdos>

The standard PC \"Master Boot Record\" (MBR) format used
by MS-DOS and Windows.  This partition type will B<only> work
for device sizes up to 2 TB.  For large disks we recommend
using C<gpt>.

Other partition table types that may work but are not
supported include:

=item B<aix>

Amiga \"Rigid Disk Block\" format.

=item B<bsd>

=item B<dasd>

DASD, used on IBM mainframes.

=item B<dvh>

=item B<mac>

Old Mac partition format.  Modern Macs use C<gpt>.

=item B<pc98>

NEC PC-98 format, common in Japan apparently.

=item B<sun>

the Linux inotify functions and Augeas (configuration file

It fails with an error if one or more of the requested
groups is unavailable in the appliance.

If an unknown group name is included in the
list of groups then an error is always returned.

=item *

You must call C<guestfs_launch> before calling this function.

The reason is because we don't know what groups are
supported by the appliance/daemon until it is running and can
be queried.

=item *

If a group of functions is available, this does not necessarily
mean that they will work.  You still have to check for errors
when calling individual API functions even if they are
available.

=item *

It is usually the job of distro packagers to build
complete functionality into the libguestfs appliance.
Upstream libguestfs, if built from source with all
requirements satisfied, will support everything.

This call was added in version C<1.0.80>.  In previous

=item 'A'

When the file is accessed, its atime is not modified.

=item 'a'

The file is append-only.

=item 'c'

The file is compressed on-disk.

=item 'D'

(Directories only.)  Changes to this directory are written
synchronously to disk.

=item 'd'

The file is not a candidate for backup (see L<dump(8)>).

=item 'E'

The file has compression errors.

=item 'e'

The file is using extents.

=item 'h'

The file is storing its blocks in units of the filesystem blocksize
instead of sectors.

=item 'I'

(Directories only.)  The directory is using hashed trees.

=item 'i'

The file is immutable.  It cannot be modified, deleted or renamed.
No link can be created to this file.

=item 'j'

The file is data-journaled.

=item 's'

When the file is deleted, all its blocks will be zeroed.

=item 'S'

Changes to this file are written synchronously to disk.

=item 'T'

(Directories only.)  This is a hint to the block allocator
that subdirectories contained in this directory should be
spread across blocks.  If not present, the block allocator
will try to group subdirectories together.

=item 't'

For a file, this disables tail-merging.
(Not used by upstream implementations of ext2.)

=item 'u'

When the file is deleted, its blocks will be saved, allowing
the file to be undeleted.

=item 'X'

The raw contents of the compressed file may be accessed.

=item 'Z'

The compressed file is dirty.
