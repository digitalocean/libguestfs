(** The libguestfs API. *)

val actions : Types.action list
(** The list of functions in the libguestfs API. *)

val daemon_functions : Types.action list -> Types.action list
val non_daemon_functions : Types.action list -> Types.action list
(** Filter {!actions}, returning only daemon function /
    non-daemon function respectively.

    The difference is that a daemon function is handled directly by
    the daemon.  A non-daemon function is implemented in the library side. *)

val external_functions : Types.action list -> Types.action list
(** Filter {!actions}, returning only external functions. *)

val internal_functions : Types.action list -> Types.action list
(** Filter {!actions}, returning only internal functions. *)

val fish_functions : Types.action list -> Types.action list
(** Filter {!actions}, returning only functions in guestfish. *)

val documented_functions : Types.action list -> Types.action list
(** Filter {!actions}, returning only functions requiring documentation. *)

val sort : Types.action list -> Types.action list
(** Sort the functions alphabetically by name
    (see also {!Utils.action_compare}). *)

val find : string -> Types.action
(** Find an action by name.  If it doesn't exist, this fails with an
    error. *)

val is_documented : Types.action -> bool
(** Returns true if function should be documented, false otherwise. *)

val test_functions : Types.action list
(** Internal test functions used to test the language bindings. *)
