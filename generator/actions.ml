This function adds a disk image called F<filename> to the handle.
F<filename> may be a regular host file or a host device.

When this function is called before C<guestfs_launch> (the
usual case) then the first time you call this function,
the disk appears in the API as F</dev/sda>, the second time
as F</dev/sdb>, and so on.

In libguestfs E<ge> 1.20 you can also call this function
after launch (with some restrictions).  This is called
\"hotplugging\".  When hotplugging, you must specify a
C<label> so that the new disk gets a predictable name.
For more information see L<guestfs(3)/HOTPLUGGING>.

You don't necessarily need to be root when using libguestfs.  However
you obviously do need sufficient permissions to access the filename
for whatever operations you want to perform (ie. read access if you
just want to read the image or write access if you want to modify the
image).

This call checks that F<filename> exists.

F<filename> may be the special string C<\"/dev/null\">.
See L<guestfs(3)/NULL DISKS>.

The optional arguments are:

=over 4

If true then the image is treated as read-only.  Writes are still
allowed, but they are stored in a temporary snapshot overlay which
is discarded at the end.  The disk that you add is not modified.

=item C<format>

This forces the image format.  If you omit this (or use C<guestfs_add_drive>
or C<guestfs_add_drive_ro>) then the format is automatically detected.
Possible formats include C<raw> and C<qcow2>.

Automatic detection of the format opens you up to a potential
security hole when dealing with untrusted raw-format images.
See CVE-2010-3851 and RHBZ#642934.  Specifying the format closes
this security hole.

=item C<iface>

This rarely-used option lets you emulate the behaviour of the
deprecated C<guestfs_add_drive_with_if> call (q.v.)

=item C<name>

The name the drive had in the original guest, e.g. F</dev/sdb>.
This is used as a hint to the guest inspection process if
it is available.

=item C<label>

Give the disk a label.  The label should be a unique, short
string using I<only> ASCII characters C<[a-zA-Z]>.
As well as its usual name in the API (such as F</dev/sda>),
the drive will also be named F</dev/disk/guestfs/I<label>>.

If not given, then the local username is used for C<ssh>, and no authentication
is attempted for ceph.  But note this sometimes may give unexpected results, for
example if using the libvirt backend and if the libvirt backend is configured to
start the qemu appliance as a special user such as C<qemu.qemu>.  If in doubt,
specify the remote username you want.

=item C<secret>

For the C<rbd> protocol only, this specifies the 'secret' to use when
connecting to the remote device.  It must be base64 encoded.

If not given, then a secret matching the given username will be looked up in the
default keychain locations, or if no username is given, then no authentication
will be used.

=item C<cachemode>

Choose whether or not libguestfs will obey sync operations (safe but slow)
or not (unsafe but fast).  The possible values for this string are:

=over 4

=item C<cachemode = \"writeback\">

This is the default.

Write operations in the API do not return until a L<write(2)>
call has completed in the host [but note this does not imply
that anything gets written to disk].

Sync operations in the API, including implicit syncs caused by
filesystem journalling, will not return until an L<fdatasync(2)>
call has completed in the host, indicating that data has been
committed to disk.

=item C<cachemode = \"unsafe\">

In this mode, there are no guarantees.  Libguestfs may cache
anything and ignore sync requests.  This is suitable only
for scratch or temporary disks.

=back

=item C<discard>

Enable or disable discard (a.k.a. trim or unmap) support on this
drive.  If enabled, operations such as C<guestfs_fstrim> will be able
to discard / make thin / punch holes in the underlying host file
or device.

Possible discard settings are:

=over 4

=item C<discard = \"disable\">

Disable discard support.  This is the default.

=item C<discard = \"enable\">

Enable discard support.  Fail if discard is not possible.

=item C<discard = \"besteffort\">

Enable discard support if possible, but don't fail if it is not
supported.

Since not all backends and not all underlying systems support
discard, this is a good choice if you want to use discard if
possible, but don't mind if it doesn't work.

=back

=item C<copyonread>

The boolean parameter C<copyonread> enables copy-on-read support.
This only affects disk formats which have backing files, and causes
reads to be stored in the overlay layer, speeding up multiple reads
of the same area of disk.

The default is false.

=item *

B<Security:> The icon data comes from the untrusted guest,
and should be treated with caution.  PNG files have been
known to contain exploits.  Ensure that libpng (or other relevant
libraries) are fully up to date before trying to process or
display the icon.

=item *

The PNG image returned can be any size.  It might not be square.
Libguestfs tries to return the largest, highest quality
icon available.  The application must scale the icon to the
required size.

Extracting icons from Windows guests requires the external
C<wrestool> program from the C<icoutils> package, and
several programs (C<bmptopnm>, C<pnmtopng>, C<pamcut>)
from the C<netpbm> package.  These must be installed separately.

=item *

C<guestfs_feature_available> is the same as this call, but
with a slightly simpler to use API: that call returns a boolean
true/false instead of throwing an error.

=item *

You must call C<guestfs_launch> before calling this function.

The reason is because we don't know what groups are
supported by the appliance/daemon until it is running and can
be queried.

=item *

If a group of functions is available, this does not necessarily
mean that they will work.  You still have to check for errors
when calling individual API functions even if they are
available.

=item *

It is usually the job of distro packagers to build
complete functionality into the libguestfs appliance.
Upstream libguestfs, if built from source with all
requirements satisfied, will support everything.

This call was added in version C<1.0.80>.  In previous

it may be that you need to create a F</boot/grub/device.map>

C<guestfs_mkmountpoint> and C<guestfs_rmmountpoint> are
specialized calls that can be used to create extra mountpoints

These calls are I<only> necessary in some very limited circumstances,
mainly the case where you want to mount a mix of unrelated and/or
read-only filesystems together.

For example, live CDs often contain a \"Russian doll\" nest of
filesystems, an ISO outer layer, with a squashfs image inside, with
an ext2/3 image inside that.  You can unpack this as follows
in guestfish:

 add-ro Fedora-11-i686-Live.iso
 run
 mkmountpoint /cd
 mkmountpoint /sqsh
 mkmountpoint /ext3fs
 mount /dev/sda /cd
 mount-loop /cd/LiveOS/squashfs.img /sqsh
 mount-loop /sqsh/LiveOS/ext3fs.img /ext3fs

The inner filesystem is now unpacked under the /ext3fs mountpoint.

C<guestfs_mkmountpoint> is not compatible with C<guestfs_umount_all>.
You may get unexpected errors if you try to mix these calls.  It is
safest to manually unmount filesystems and remove mountpoints after use.

C<guestfs_umount_all> unmounts filesystems by sorting the paths
longest first, so for this to work for manual mountpoints, you
must ensure that the innermost mountpoints have the longest
pathnames, as in the example code above.

This command creates a new inotify handle.
The inotify subsystem can be used to notify events which happen to
objects in the guest filesystem.

C<maxevents> is the maximum number of events which will be
queued up between calls to C<guestfs_inotify_read> or
C<guestfs_inotify_files>.
If this is passed as C<0>, then the kernel (or previously set)
default is used.  For Linux 2.6.29 the default was 16384 events.
Beyond this limit, the kernel throws away events, but records
the fact that it threw them away by setting a flag
C<IN_Q_OVERFLOW> in the returned structure list (see
C<guestfs_inotify_read>).

Before any events are generated, you have to add some
watches to the internal watch list.  See: C<guestfs_inotify_add_watch> and
C<guestfs_inotify_rm_watch>.

Queued up events should be read periodically by calling
C<guestfs_inotify_read>
(or C<guestfs_inotify_files> which is just a helpful
wrapper around C<guestfs_inotify_read>).  If you don't
read the events out often enough then you risk the internal
queue overflowing.

The handle should be closed after use by calling
C<guestfs_inotify_close>.  This also removes any
watches automatically.

See also L<inotify(7)> for an overview of the inotify interface
as exposed by the Linux kernel, which is roughly what we expose
via libguestfs.  Note that there is one global inotify handle

This can be used to resolve case insensitive paths on

to resolve paths which you have read from Windows configuration

The command handles a peculiarity of the Linux ntfs-3g
filesystem driver (and probably others), which is that although
the underlying filesystem is case-insensitive, the driver
exports the filesystem to Linux as case-sensitive.

One consequence of this is that special directories such
as F<C:\\windows> may appear as F</WINDOWS> or F</windows>
(or other things) depending on the precise details of how
they were created.  In Windows itself this would not be
a problem.

Bug or feature?  You decide:
L<http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/#posixfilenames1>

C<guestfs_case_sensitive_path> attempts to resolve the true case of
each element in the path. It will return a resolved path if either the
full path or its parent directory exists. If the parent directory
exists but the full path does not, the case of the parent directory
will be correctly resolved, and the remainder appended unmodified. For
example, if the file C<\"/Windows/System32/netkvm.sys\"> exists:

You cannot use this optional parameter with the C<gfs> or

=over 4

=item C<force>

Force tune2fs to complete the operation even in the face of errors.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-f> option.

=item C<maxmountcount>

Set the number of mounts after which the filesystem is checked
by L<e2fsck(8)>.  If this is C<0> then the number of mounts is
disregarded.  This is the same as the tune2fs C<-c> option.

=item C<mountcount>

Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-C> option.

=item C<errorbehavior>

Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are detected.
Possible values currently are: C<continue>, C<remount-ro>, C<panic>.
In practice these options don't really make any difference,
particularly for write errors.

This is the same as the tune2fs C<-e> option.

=item C<group>

Set the group which can use reserved filesystem blocks.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-g> option except that it
can only be specified as a number.

=item C<intervalbetweenchecks>

Adjust the maximal time between two filesystem checks
(in seconds).  If the option is passed as C<0> then
time-dependent checking is disabled.

This is the same as the tune2fs C<-i> option.

=item C<reservedblockspercentage>

Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only be allocated
by privileged processes.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-m> option.

=item C<lastmounteddirectory>

Set the last mounted directory.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-M> option.

=item C<reservedblockscount>
Set the number of reserved filesystem blocks.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-r> option.

=item C<user>

Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks.
This is the same as the tune2fs C<-u> option except that it
can only be specified as a number.

A bitmap of missing devices.  If a bit is set it means that a
missing device is added to the array.  The least significant bit
corresponds to the first device in the array.

If C<devices = [\"/dev/sda\"]> and C<missingbitmap = 0x1> then

The C<acl> parameter is the new ACL in either \"long text form\"
or \"short text form\" (see L<acl(5)>).  The new ACL completely
replaces any previous ACL on the file.  The ACL must contain the
full Unix permissions (eg. C<u::rwx,g::rx,o::rx>).

If you are specifying individual users or groups, then the
mask field is also required (eg. C<m::rwx>), followed by the
C<u:I<ID>:...> and/or C<g:I<ID>:...> field(s).  A full ACL
string might therefore look like this:

 u::rwx,g::rwx,o::rwx,m::rwx,u:500:rwx,g:500:rwx
 \\ Unix permissions / \\mask/ \\      ACL        /

You should use numeric UIDs and GIDs.  To map usernames and
groupnames to the correct numeric ID in the context of the
guest, use the Augeas functions (see C<guestfs_aug_init>)." };

C<start> and C<max> are specified in bytes, with the usual

For example to edit the first few sectors of a disk you
might do:

 hexedit /dev/sda 1M

of the disk.

 hexedit /dev/sda1 0x400 0x400
