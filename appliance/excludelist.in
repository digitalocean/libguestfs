/* This is the list of distro packages which are
 * excluded from the appliance, even if they appear in
 * packagelist.in (or more likely, as dependencies of
 * packages in packagelist.in).
 *
 * List is a list of basic regular expressions, one per line.
 *
 * This file is processed by cpp with one of the
 * following symbols defined (depending on the distro):
 *
 *   REDHAT=1     For Fedora, RHEL, EPEL and workalikes.
 *   DEBIAN=1     For Debian.
 *   UBUNTU=1     For Ubuntu.
 *   ARCHLINUX=1  For Archlinux.
 *
 * Note that any file provided by one of these packages will
 * be dropped from the appliance.  Of course, this may break
 * the appliance, so be careful.  Other files are also dropped
 * from the appliance such as docs and man pages: see 'make.sh.in'
 * for the full details.
