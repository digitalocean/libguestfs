=head1 NAME

virt-rescue - Run a rescue shell on a virtual machine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-rescue [--options] domname

 virt-rescue [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...]

=head1 WARNING

You must I<not> use C<virt-rescue> on live virtual machines.  Doing so
will probably result in disk corruption in the VM.  C<virt-rescue>
tries to stop you from doing this, but doesn't catch all cases.

However if you use the I<--ro> (read only) option, then you can attach
a shell to a live virtual machine, but the results might be strange or
inconsistent at times (but you won't get disk corruption).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

virt-rescue gives you a rescue shell and some simple recovery tools
which you can use on a virtual machine disk image.

After running virt-rescue, what you see under C</> is the recovery
appliance.

You must mount the virtual machine's filesystems by hand.  There
is a directory C</sysroot> where you can mount filesystems.  For
example:

 ><rescue> lvs
 LV      VG        Attr   LSize   Origin Snap%  Move Log Copy%  Convert
 lv_root vg_f11x64 -wi-a-   8.83G
 lv_swap vg_f11x64 -wi-a- 992.00M
 ><rescue> mount /dev/vg_f11x64/lv_root /sysroot
 ><rescue> ls /sysroot

This tool is just designed for quick interactive hacking on a virtual
machine.  For more structured access to a virtual machine disk image,
you should use L<guestfs(3)>.  To get a structured shell, use
L<guestfish(1)>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=cut

my $help;

=item B<--help>

Display brief help.

=cut

my $version;

=item B<--version>

Display version number and exit.

=cut

my $uri;

=item B<--connect URI> | B<-c URI>

If using libvirt, connect to the given I<URI>.  If omitted, then we
connect to the default libvirt hypervisor.

If you specify guest block devices directly, then libvirt is not used
at all.

=cut

my $readonly;

=item B<--ro> | B<-r>

Open the image read-only.

The option must always be used if the disk image or virtual machine
might be running, and is generally recommended in cases where you
don't need write access to the disk.
