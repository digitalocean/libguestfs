=head1 NAME

virt-edit - Edit a file in a virtual machine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-edit [--options] domname file

 virt-edit [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...] file

=head1 WARNING

You must I<not> use C<virt-edit> on live virtual machines.  If you do
this, you risk disk corruption in the VM.  C<virt-edit> tries to stop
you from doing this, but doesn't catch all cases.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<virt-edit> is a command line tool to edit C<file> where C<file>
exists in the named virtual machine (or disk image).

If you want to just view a file, use L<virt-cat(1)>.  For more complex
cases you should look at the L<guestfish(1)> tool.

=head1 EXAMPLES

 virt-edit mydomain /boot/grub/grub.conf

 virt-edit mydomain /etc/passwd

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=cut

my $help;

=item B<--help>

Display brief help.

=cut

my $version;

=item B<--version>

Display version number and exit.

=cut

my $uri;

=item B<--connect URI> | B<-c URI>

If using libvirt, connect to the given I<URI>.  If omitted, then we
connect to the default libvirt hypervisor.

If you specify guest block devices directly, then libvirt is not used
at all.
