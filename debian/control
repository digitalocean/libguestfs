Description: guest disk image management system - file system shell
 The libguestfs library allows accessing and modifying guest disk
 images. It offers the following features, among many others:
  * making batch configuration changes to guests;
  * viewing and editing files inside guests;
  * getting disk used/free statistics;
  * migrating between virtualization systems;
  * performing partial backups;
  * performing partial guest clones;
  * cloning guests and changing registry/UUID/hostname info.
 .
 It uses the Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of guest
 file system that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited to: ext2/3/4,
 btrfs, FAT and NTFS, LVM, many different disk partition schemes, qcow, qcow2,
 vmdk.
 .
 The library provides ways to enumerate guest storage (such as partitions, LVs,
 what file system is in each LV, etc.); to run commands in the context of the
 guest; and to upload and download files and directories.
 .
 Guestfish is a shell and command-line tool for examining and modifying
 virtual machine file systems. It uses libguestfs and exposes all of the
 functionality of the guestfs API; see guestfs(3).
