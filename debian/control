Description: library for accessing and modifying guest disk images
 libguestfs is a library for accessing and modifying guest disk images. Amongst
 the things this is good for: making batch configuration changes to guests,
 viewing and editing files inside guests, getting disk used/free statistics,
 migrating between virtualization systems, performing partial backups,
 performing partial guest clones, cloning guests and changing
 registry/UUID/hostname info, and much else besides.
 .
 It uses Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of guest
 filesystem that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited to: ext2/3/4,
 btrfs, FAT and NTFS, LVM, many different disk partition schemes, qcow, qcow2,
 vmdk.
 .
 libguestfs provides ways to enumerate guest storage (eg. partitions, LVs, what
 filesystem is in each LV, etc.). It can also run commands in the context of 
 the guest. Also you can upload and download files and directories.

Package: guestfish
Section: devel
Architecture: any
Depends: libguestfs0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: libguestfs filesystem interactive shell
 Guestfish is a shell and command-line tool for examining and modifying
 virtual machine filesystems.  It uses libguestfs and exposes all of the
 functionality of the guestfs API, see guestfs(3).

Package: guestmount
Section: devel
Architecture: any
Depends: libguestfs0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: mount guest filesystem using libguestfs and FUSE
 The guestmount program can be used to mount virtual machine filesystems
 and other disk images on the host.  It uses libguestfs for access to
 the guest filesystem, and FUSE (the "filesystem in userspace") to make
 it appear as a mountable device.
