This directory contains tests for the hivex library.

'minimal' is a valid registry containing a single root nk (with
associated sk) which was created by chopping out everything possible
from a Windows 2003 software hive and then doing lots of hand edits on
the result.  There is no "source" for it as such, it is just a
hand-crafted binary blob.
