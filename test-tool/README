This is a test tool, not a comprehensive test, but a "does it
basically function" test, which can be packaged and given to end
users.

It also collects and prints a lot of internal debug information, which
is useful in bug reports to track down appliance / qemu boot problems.

For more information, please read the man page
libguestfs-test-tool(1).
