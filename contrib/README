Random contributions and things which don't fit in anywhere else
----------------------------------------------------------------------

autobuild/
        The autobuild script that we use to build and test the
        tarballs on Debian and elsewhere.

intro/ "Slides" for an intro to libguestfs.  This is a short (10-15
        min) talk that I give to introduce the main features of
        libguestfs.  The slides are in the form of a complete
        self-contained HTML page with a handful images that can be
        easily distributed before the talk.

make-check-on-installed.pl
        This Perl script allows you to run the test suite (ie.  'make
        check', 'make check-all' etc) on an installed RPM.  This is
        useful for adding another layer of testing to packages before
        we release them.  Note that a checked out copy of the source
        from git is required.  Read the top of the file before using.

p2v/    Hacky script to build virt-p2v ISO on top of RHEL 5/6/7,
        for 32 bit (i686) and 64 bit (x86-64).

windows-icons.pl
        This script lets you extract all the icons from a Windows
        guest.  We use this to locate the Windows logo in new releases
        of Windows (see lib/inspect-icon.c).

visualize-alignment/
        Tests for visualizing block device reads and writes and
        alignment using a patched qemu.  See the README file in that
        directory.
