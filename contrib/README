autobuild/
        The autobuild script that we use to build and test the
        tarballs on Debian and elsewhere.

centos5.3-libguestfs.spec
        [REMOVED]
        This used to be a centos5.3 specfile.  Please use the specfile
        from EL-5 here:
        http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=libguestfs.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/el5/master
        or the RHEL 5 source RPMs here:
        http://libguestfs.org/download/binaries/rhel5-packages/

febootstrap/
        [REMOVED]
        An experimental, non-working attempt to use febootstrap
        to install operating systems.

fedora-libguestfs.spec
        [REMOVED]
        This used to be a Fedora 10+ specfile.  Please use the specfile
        from Fedora instead:
        http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=libguestfs.git

guestfsd-in-wine.sh
        Run a Windows-compiled guestfsd under Wine.  Read the
        instructions at the top of this file carefully.

intro/ "Slides" for an intro to libguestfs.  This is a short (10-15
        min) talk that I give to introduce the main features of
        libguestfs.  The slides are in the form of a complete
        self-contained HTML page with a handful images that can be
        easily distributed before the talk.

make-check-on-installed.pl
        This Perl script allows you to run the test suite (ie.  'make
        check', 'make extra-tests' etc) on an installed RPM.  This is
        useful for adding another layer of testing to packages before
        we release them.  Note that a checked out copy of the source
        from git is required.  Read the top of the file before using.

visualize-alignment/
        Tests for visualizing block device reads and writes and
        alignment using a patched qemu.  See the README file in that
        directory.
