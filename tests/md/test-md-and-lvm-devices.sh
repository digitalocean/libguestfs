# Test guestfish finds:
# 1. md device created from physical block device and LV,
# 2. md device created from LVs
# 3. LV created on md device
#
# raid0 is used for md device because it is inoperable if one of its components
# is inaccessible so it is easy observable that md device is missing (raid1 in
# this case will be operable but in degraded state).
