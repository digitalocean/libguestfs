The tests in this directory simply run SYSLINUX/EXTLINUX (if
available) to make sure they work.

However if you want, you can also try booting the resultant guests,
although this is not part of the test.

  qemu-kvm -hda syslinux-guest.img
  qemu-kvm -hda extlinux-guest.img

Note that there is just a kernel, no operating system, inside these
guests so the Linux kernel is expected to panic once it tries to find
an init process to run.  (You could modify these tests to add an init
process if you wanted to).
