=head1 NAME

virt-cat - Display a file in a virtual machine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-cat [--options] domname file

 virt-cat [--options] disk.img [disk.img ...] file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<virt-cat> is a command line tool to display the contents of C<file>
where C<file> exists in the named virtual machine (or disk image).

C<virt-cat> can be used to quickly view a single file.  For more
complex cases you should look at the L<guestfish(1)> tool.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Display C</etc/fstab> file from inside the libvirt VM called
C<mydomain>:

 virt-cat mydomain /etc/fstab

List syslog messages from a VM:

 virt-cat mydomain /var/log/messages | tail

Find out what packages were recently installed:

 virt-cat mydomain /var/log/yum.log | tail

Find out who is logged on inside a virtual machine:

 virt-cat mydomain /var/run/utmp > /tmp/utmp
 who /tmp/utmp

or who was logged on:

 virt-cat mydomain /var/log/wtmp > /tmp/wtmp
 last -f /tmp/wtmp

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=cut

my $help;

=item B<--help>

Display brief help.

=cut

my $version;

=item B<--version>

Display version number and exit.

=cut

my $uri;

=item B<--connect URI> | B<-c URI>

If using libvirt, connect to the given I<URI>.  If omitted, then we
connect to the default libvirt hypervisor.

If you specify guest block devices directly, then libvirt is not used
at all.
