Missing features compared to Perl version:

 - user-custom in virt-v2v.conf to install custom packages (virt-customize?)
 - Windows support
 - Fix configure_kernel on SUSE (see Mike Latimer's email)
 - RHEV-M metadata
 - testing

Notes on the support matrix for upstream virt-v2v:

- All these in 32- and 64-bit variants.

- All these as Xen HV and PV variants, and ESX guests.

- RHEL 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
- RHEL 4.5, 4.8, 5.2, 5.4 - tested particularly because virtio was added
  between these releases.

- Windows XP, 2000, 2003, 2008.

- SUSE: OpenSUSE 13.1, SLES11 SP3, SLES12.

- VirtualBox: Not tested.
