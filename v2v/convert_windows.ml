    (* NTFS hardcodes the number of heads on the drive which created
       it in the filesystem header. Modern versions of Windows
       sensibly ignore it, but both Windows XP and Windows 2000
       require it to be correct in order to boot from the drive. If it
       isn't you get:

       'A disk read error occurred. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart'

       QEMU has some code in block.c:guess_disk_lchs() which on the face
       of it appears to infer the drive geometry from the MBR if it's
       valid. However, my tests have shown that a Windows XP guest
       hosted on both RHEL 5 and F14 requires the heads field in NTFS to
       be the following, based solely on drive size:

       Range                             Heads
       size < 2114445312                 0x40
       2114445312 <= size < 4228374780   0x80
       4228374780 <= size                0xFF

       I have not tested drive sizes less than 1G, which require fewer
       heads, as this limitation applies only to the boot device and it
       is not possible to install XP on a drive this size.

       The following page has good information on the layout of NTFS in
       Windows XP/2000:

       http://mirror.href.com/thestarman/asm/mbr/NTFSBR.htm

       Technet has this:

       http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc781134(WS.10).aspx#w2k3tr_ntfs_how_dhao

       however, as this is specific to Windows 2003 it lists location
       0x1A as unused.
