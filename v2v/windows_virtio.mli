(** Functions for installing Windows virtio drivers. *)

val install_drivers
    : Guestfs.guestfs -> Types.inspect -> string -> int64 -> string ->
      Types.guestcaps_block_type * Types.guestcaps_net_type * Types.guestcaps_video_type
(** [install_drivers g inspect systemroot root current_cs rcaps]
    installs virtio drivers from the driver directory or driver
    ISO into the guest driver directory and updates the registry
    so that the [viostor.sys] driver gets loaded by Windows at boot.

    [root] is the root node of the system hive (which is open for writes
    when this function is called).  [current_cs] is the name of the
    [CurrentControlSet] (eg. ["ControlSet001"]).

    This returns the tuple [(block_driver, net_driver, video_driver)]
    reflecting what devices are now required by the guest, either
    virtio devices if we managed to install those, or legacy devices
    if we didn't. *)
