Missing features compared to Perl version:

 - user-custom in virt-v2v.conf to install custom packages (virt-customize?)
 - Fix configure_kernel on SUSE (see Mike Latimer's email)

virt-v2v bash (tab) completion

Proper progress bars when copying.

Better handling of removable devices in -i ova / -o rhev.  At the
moment input_ova.ml doesn't record the bus and slot of removable
devices properly, and output_(rhev|vdsm).ml doesn't try to put devices
into the right slots.  (See RHBZ#1238053 for all the details).
