Missing features compared to Perl version:

 - user-custom in virt-v2v.conf to install custom packages (virt-customize?)
 - Fix configure_kernel on SUSE (see Mike Latimer's email)
 - RHEV-M metadata
 - testing
 - -o libvirt

p2v:

 - network dialog and network configuration
 - control where the image is sent (ie. RHEV ESD, libvirt, etc)

For OVA support we need to have the source write to the final target
directory (where possible as it might not always be possible to do
that).  One way to do this is to have an early target hook, called
before Target_*.initialize.  This could return a hint to indicate
whether the target supports writing directly to the output storage
directory, and where that is, and then the source could use that to
write directory.  Also s_disks would need to contain a flag to
indicate that the main code shouldn't create overlays in this case.

Consider turning inputs and outputs into classes, so
source_libvirt -> input_libvirt which is a subclass of input.
