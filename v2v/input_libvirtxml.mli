(** Take libvirt XML and parse it into a {!Types.source} structure and a

    {b Note} the [source.s_disks] field is an empty list.  The caller
    must map over the parsed disks and update the [source.s_disks] field.

    This function is also used by {!Input_libvirt}, hence it is
    exported. *)

val input_libvirtxml : string -> Types.input
(** [input_libvirtxml xml_file] creates and returns a new
    {!Types.input} object specialized for reading input from local
    libvirt XML files. *)
