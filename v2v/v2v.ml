(* Estimate the space required on the target for each disk.  It is the
 * maximum space that might be required, but in reasonable cases much
 * less space would actually be needed.
 *
 * As a starting point we could take ov_virtual_size (plus a tiny
 * overhead for qcow2 headers etc) as the maximum.  However that's not
 * very useful.  Other information we have available is:
 *
 * - The list of filesystems across the source disk(s).
 *
 * - The disk used/free of each of those filesystems, and the
 * filesystem type.
 *
 * Note that we do NOT have the used size of the source disk (because
 * it may be remote).
 *
 * How do you attribute filesystem usage through to backing disks,
 * since one filesystem might span multiple disks?
 *
 * How do you account for non-filesystem usage (eg. swap, partitions
 * that libguestfs cannot read, the space between LVs/partitions)?
 *
 * Another wildcard is that although we try to run {c fstrim} on each
 * source filesystem, it can fail in some common scenarios.  Also
 * qemu-img will do zero detection.  Both of these can be big wins when
 * they work.
 *
 * The algorithm used here is this:
 *
 * (1) Calculate the total virtual size of all guest filesystems.
 * eg: [ "/boot" = 500 MB, "/" = 2.5 GB ], total = 3 GB
 *
 * (2) Calculate the total virtual size of all source disks.
 * eg: [ sda = 1 GB, sdb = 3 GB ], total = 4 GB
 *
 * (3) The ratio of (1):(2) is the maximum that could be freed up if
 * all filesystems were effectively zeroed out during the conversion.
 * eg. ratio = 3/4
 *
 * (4) Work out how much filesystem space we are likely to save if
 * fstrim works, but exclude a few cases where fstrim will probably
 * fail (eg. filesystems that don't support fstrim).  This is the
 * conversion saving.
 * eg. [ "/boot" = 200 MB used, "/" = 1 GB used ], saving = 3 - 1.2 = 1.8
 *
 * (5) Scale the conversion saving (4) by the ratio (3), and allocate
 * that saving across all source disks in proportion to their
 * virtual size.
 * eg. scaled saving is 1.8 * 3/4 = 1.35 GB
 *     sda has 1/4 of total virtual size, so it gets a saving of 1.35/4
 *     sda final estimated size = 1 - (1.35/4) = 0.6625 GB
 *     sdb has 3/4 of total virtual size, so it gets a saving of 3 * 1.35 / 4
 *     sdb final estimate size = 3 - (3*1.35/4) = 1.9875 GB
