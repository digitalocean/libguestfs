# From the libtool info file, with comments:
#
# |  1. Start with version information of `0:0:0' for each libtool library.
# |
# |  2. Update the version information only immediately before a public
# |     release of your software.  More frequent updates are unnecessary,
# |     and only guarantee that the current interface number gets larger
# |     faster.
# |
# |  3. If the library source code has changed at all since the last
# |     update, then increment REVISION (`C:R:A' becomes `C:r+1:A').
#
# [So it seems like we should always update the middle 'R' field
# for any release.]
#
# |  4. If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the
# |     last update, increment CURRENT, and set REVISION to 0.
# |
# |  5. If any interfaces have been added since the last public release,
# |     then increment AGE.
#
# [These two rules seem to mean that if any change is made to the
# generator, we should increment C and A, and set R to 0, so:
# C+1:0:A+1.]
#
# |  6. If any interfaces have been removed since the last public release,
# |     then set AGE to 0.
#
# [Our ABI guarantee means we won't remove interfaces except in
# very exceptional circumstances.]
#
# The maximum proc number (see guestfs_protocol.x:guestfs_procedure) is
# a mostly accurate stand-in for C & A in rules 5 & 6, so we use that.  It
# is always incremented when we add a new appliance interface, and easy to
# calculate.
#
# The middle number is hard to increment-and-reset as described in rules
# 4 & 5, so for the moment it is always set to 0.
#
# Note that this scheme means the real library version will always be
# 'libguestfs.so.0.$(MAX_PROC_NR).0'.
