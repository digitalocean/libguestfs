2012-04-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	python: Remove 'del g' from the docs, replace with 'g.close ()'.
	'del g' is a trap for the unwary.  If the handle has any other
	references, it does nothing (in fact, it can be actively dangerous if
	the user was expecting the appliance to go away).  In non-CPython it
	can be delayed arbitrarily long.

	Using 'g.close()' on the other hand is always safe.

	sparsify: Fix comma/colon and quoting in qemu-img command.
	Colon characters are not allowed in qemu/qemu-img filenames.  There's
	no way to quote them.

	Comma characters CAN be used.  However they must be quoted (by
	doubling) when used in the '-o' option.

	Fix general quoting problems in the external command.

	Version 1.16.18.

	extra-tests: ocaml: Use a short delay instead of Thread.yield.
	On the new faster computer, Thread.yield wasn't yielding, so the
	second thread would block the main test from proceeding (only when run
	under valgrind however).

	po-docs: Allow parallel builds in po-docs directory.
	The first time the directory is checked out from git, there are no
	*.pod files.  In a parallel build, the first thread notices this and
	runs the 'make -C .. update-po' rule, but the other threads also try
	to run at the same time and fail.

	sysprep: Allow hwaddr to be removed on other Red Hat derivatives (RHBZ#811117). Allow hostname to be set on other Red Hat derivatives (RHBZ#811112).
	Since virt-sysprep has been rewritten on the development branch, this

2012-04-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tests: Fix guest building so parallel 'make -jN check' works.
	This means renaming various temporary files (eg. fstab.tmp) that
	several of the scripts were using so they don't conflict
	(eg. fstab.tmp.$$).

	Also the rule:

	  fedora-md1.img fedora-md2.img: guest-aux/make-fedora-img.pl

	causes the script to run twice in parallel when using 'make -jN'.
	Replace this with a stamp file so it runs once:

	  fedora-md1.img fedora-md2.img: stamp-fedora-md.img
	  stamp-fedora-md.img: guest-aux/make-fedora-img.pl

	inspection: Set last errno to ENOTSUP when inspection APIs are not available.
	Previously there was no programmatic way to tell if inspection APIs
	were unavailable because they are not compiled in (because hivex isn't
	around).  This contrasts with daemon APIs where the availability is
	covered by the guestfs_available API.

	Change the inspection APIs so that when they are not available, the
	last errno is set to ENOTSUP.  (Note that ENOTSUP must be defined on
	all POSIX platforms).

	This allows programs to detect if they are using a version of
	libguestfs that was compiled without support for inspection, without
	having to parse error messages.

	Close all file descriptors and remove all signal handlers in the recovery process.
	If the parent process uses a pipe (or any fd, but pipes are a
	particular problem), then the recovery process would hold open the
	file descriptor(s) of the pipe, meaning that it could not be fully
	closed in the parent.  Because the recovery process doesn't use
	exec(2), this wasn't avoidable even using FD_CLOEXEC.

	Avoid this by closing all file descriptors when starting the recovery
	process.

	After discussion with Dan Berrange, he points out that it's also a
	good idea to set signal handlers to the default after forking, so that
	any signal handlers set up in the parent don't affect the child.

	Test fails in arch linux
	--20cf303ea4a84a7a7c04ba331375
	Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

	Hello Richard,

	I found what the problem was and the udev symlinks where not created. The
	init script in the appliance uses a full paths for udevadm (/sbin/udevadm)
	which in my case was wrong. In Arch Linux udevadm is hosted under /usr/bin,
	not /sbin. When I fixed this, libguestfs was able to communicate with the
	appliance VM.

	Since PATH variable is defined and exported in init, there is no need in
	using full paths for external programs. As far as I've seen this affects
	all the git branches in libguestfs's repository. Please find attached a
	patch for the master branch.

	Nikos Skalkotos,
	Athens, Greece

	Hello Richard,<br><br>I found what the problem was and the udev symlinks where not created. The init script in the appliance uses a full paths for udevadm (/sbin/udevadm) which in my case was wrong. In Arch Linux udevadm is hosted under /usr/bin, not /sbin. When I fixed this, libguestfs was able to communicate with the appliance VM.<br>
	<br>Since PATH variable is defined and exported in init, there is no need in using full paths for external programs. As far as I&#39;ve seen this affects all the git branches in libguestfs&#39;s repository. Please find attached a patch for the master branch.<br>

	I don&#39;t know specifically why it fails with ArchLinux, but the problem<br>
	is caused by the /dev/virtio-ports/* symlinks not getting created by<br>
	udev.<br>
	<br>
	/dev/vport0p1 exists:<br>

	<div class="im"><br>
	&gt; /dev/virtio-ports/org.libguestfs.channel.0: No such file or directory<br>
	<br>
	</div>The symlink is supposed to be created by this udev rule:<br>
	<br>
	/lib/udev/rules.d/50-udev-default.rules:KERNEL==&quot;vport*&quot;, ATTR{name}==&quot;?*&quot;, SYMLINK+=&quot;virtio-ports/$attr{name}&quot;<br>
	<br>
	So I&#39;d start by looking to see if that rule exists in the udev rules<br>
	that Arch is using.  Secondly if it does exist, is the corresponding<br>
	*.rules being copied into the appliance?  (Check appliance/supermin.d/<br>
	hostfiles)<br>
	<br>
	In an old Ubuntu that has udev that predates having this rule, we add<br>

2012-03-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.16.6.

	resize: Fix --output-format flag (RHBZ#798196).

	sysprep: Try unmounting the filesystem a few times when busy.
	tracker-miner-fs jumps into newly mounted filesystems.  This prevents
	the filesystem from being unmounted, so retry a few times.
	(cherry picked from commit 5fa7aace200a49961173de6316a81e239987c179)

2012-03-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Make appliance building thread-safe (RHBZ#790721).
	Appliance building can be called from multiple processes, but this is
	only safe if each process holds a lock on the 'checksum' file.
	However threads within a process are not excluded by a file lock, and
	so this strategy completely failed for a multithreaded program calling
	guestfs_launch in parallel.

	Since it makes no sense for threads in a single program to race each
	other to try to create the appliance, add a lock around appliance
	building.

	This serialises building the appliance, but the rest of guestfs_launch
	(eg. starting up qemu) can run in parallel.
	(cherry picked from commit afed7e493dcd594620f19b93e9fb73e58553f60a)

	Version 1.16.5.

	regressions: One test is not being run.
	rhbz727178.sh exists, but historically was never added to the list of
	tests, so it doesn't run.  Create a special variable for this test and
	ensure it is added to EXTRA_DIST.

	daemon: Return error properly when user tries to mount appliance root (RHBZ#789960).
	In the case where the caller attempts to mount the "hidden"
	appliance root device (eg. /dev/vdb if /dev/vda is the only
	normal block device added), we were calling reply_with_error
	but not actually returning immediately, resulting in protocol
	desynchronization.

	This commit fixes this obvious mistake.

2012-02-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Don't xdr_free uninitialized args struct on error paths.
	For stubs of functions that had arguments, code did this:

	static void
	mount_stub (XDR *xdr_in)
	{
	  int r;
	  struct guestfs_mount_args args;

	  if (optargs_bitmask != 0) {
	    //...
	    goto done;
	  }
	  // possibly other tests here

	  memset (&args, 0, sizeof args);

	  [...]

	done:
	  xdr_free ((xdrproc_t) xdr_guestfs_mount_args, (char *) &args);
	  return;
	}

	This caused xdr_free to be called on uninitialized 'args' struct,
	causing a segfault.

	The fix is to add another label, so the code looks like:

	static void
	mount_stub (XDR *xdr_in)
	{
	  int r;
	  struct guestfs_mount_args args;

	  if (optargs_bitmask != 0) {
	    //...
	    goto done_no_free;
	  }
	  // possibly other tests here

	  memset (&args, 0, sizeof args);

	  [...]

	done:
	  xdr_free ((xdrproc_t) xdr_guestfs_mount_args, (char *) &args);
	done_no_free:
	  return;
	}

	This fixes commit 330fbea5b2d6bd7db84f7ea7afe87cf1bcd438e0
	and commit 0344248af55802bbbd816b349ec1ba9305996f6e.

2012-02-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Clarify the error message when unavailable functions are called (RHBZ#679737).
	Callers are supposed to use the availability API to check for
	functions that may not be available in particular builds of
	libguestfs.  If they don't do this, currently they tend to get obscure
	error messages, eg:

	  libguestfs: error: zerofree: /dev/vda1: zerofree: No such file or directory

	This commit changes the error message to explain what callers ought to
	be doing instead:

	  libguestfs: error: zerofree: feature 'zerofree' is not available in this
	  build of libguestfs.  Read 'AVAILABILITY' in the guestfs(3) man page for
	  how to check for the availability of features.

	This patch makes the stubs check for availability.  The stub code
	changes to:

	  static void
	  zerofree_stub (XDR *xdr_in)
	  {
	  [...]

	    /* The caller should have checked before calling this. */
	    if (! optgroup_zerofree_available ()) {
	      reply_with_error ("feature '%s' is not available in this\n"
	                        "build of libguestfs.  Read 'AVAILABILITY' in the guestfs(3) man page for\n"
	                        "how to check for the availability of features.",
	                        "zerofree");
	      goto done;
	    }

	RConstOptString cannot return an error in the C api. This makes it a special

	includes the possibility of an error return in the API. An error is indicated by
	setting *err to a non-NULL value.

	This change is in preparation for adding a close api. An attempt to call any
	api, even RConstOptString, on a closed handle must return an error.

	Enable running the daemon under valgrind.
	This commit allows you to run the daemon under valgrind.  You have to
	enable it at configure time:

	  ./configure --enable-valgrind-daemon

	This should *not* be done for production builds.

	When this feature is enabled, valgrind is added to the appliance and
	the daemon is run under valgrind.  Log messages from valgrind are
	passed back over a virtio-serial channel into a file called
	'valgrind.log.$PID' in the top build directory.

	Running 'make check', 'make extra-tests' etc causes many
	valgrind.log.* files to be created which must be examined by hand.

	maint: use $var notation rather than ${var} when possible
	I noticed some uses of ${srcdir} in shell scripts.
	That is almost always better written as $srcdir.
	The patch below converts most such variable references.
	Here are the few remaining candidates:

	$ git grep -i -E '\$\{[a-zA-Z_0-9]+\}'|grep -v Makefile.in.in
	configure.ac:        JAR_INSTALL_DIR=\${prefix}/share/java
	configure.ac:        JNI_INSTALL_DIR=\${libdir}
	debian/rules:   for TEST in ${DEBIAN_SKIP_TEST}; do \
	debian/rules:#          mv $${mod} $$(dirname $${mod})/libguestfsmod.so; \
	java/Makefile.am:libguestfs_jar_DATA = libguestfs-${VERSION}.jar
	java/Makefile.am:libguestfs-${VERSION}.jar: $(libguestfs_jar_class_files)
	perl/lib/Sys/Guestfs/Lib.pm:                      "-f", '${Package} ${Version} ${Architecture} ${Status}\n',
	perl/typemap:            croak (\"${Package}::$func_name(): called on a closed handle\");
	perl/typemap:        croak (\"${Package}::$func_name(): $var is not a blessed HV reference\");
	tests/data/Makefile.am:   echo "$${i}abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"; \

	We could change all of those, too, except the ones in configure.ac
	and Makefile.am, since they refer to Make variables.  Even those
	should be changed, but to use the preferred Makefile notation:
	$(prefix), $(libdir), $(VERSION).

	Subject: [PATCH libguestfs] maint: use $var notation rather than ${var} when
	 possible

	The only case to avoid in a shell script is when the byte after the
	"}" is word-constituent, and concatenating it would thus change the
	name of the variable.

	These changes were induced by running this command:
	  git grep -l -i -E '\$\{(srcdir|md)' \
	    |xargs perl -pi -e 's/\$\{(srcdir|md)\}($|\w)/\$$1$2/gi'

	The "g" was needed because there was one line with two instances.
	The "i" is to handle ${SRCDIR}.  The ($|\w) ensures that concatenating
	whatever follows the "}" won't change semantics.

	* gobject/run-bindtests: Use "$srcdir", not "${srcdir}".
	* haskell/run-bindtests: Likewise.
	* java/run-bindtests: Likewise.
	* ocaml/run-bindtests: Likewise.
	* perl/run-bindtests: Likewise.
	* python/run-bindtests: Likewise.
	* ruby/run-bindtests: Likewise.
	* tests/guests/guest-aux/make-debian-img.sh: Likewise, but $SRCDIR.
	* tests/guests/guest-aux/make-ubuntu-img.sh: Likewise.
	* tests/guests/guest-aux/make-windows-img.sh: Likewise.
	* tests/md/test-mdadm.sh: Likewise, but $md.

	Note that this change disables compiling and running the haskell bindtests. The

	generator: Add CamelName flag
	We can make a good guess at camel case names for most APIs. For example,

	apis don't produce a satisfactory name when transformed automatically. For
	example, we would want md_create to produce MDCreate rather than MdCreate.

	Version 1.15.18.

	Update release notes.

	daemon: Run udev_settle after pwrite-device finishes.
	When you call close on any block device, udev kicks off a rule which
	runs blkid to reexamine the device.  We need to wait for this rule to
	finish running since it holds the device open and can cause other
	operations to fail, notably BLKRRPART.

	appliance: Add psmisc package to the appliance.
	This allows us to use 'fuser' and other ps tools.

	daemon: pwrite/pread: Don't double close on error path.
	In Linux, close (fd) closes the file descriptor even if it returns an
	error.

	ocaml: Use automake to build the C part of the bindings.
	By arranging the C part of the bindings into a library, we can get
	automake to build it instead of using $(CC) directly.

	ocaml: Don't include guestfs-internal.h directly.
	However since the OCaml bindings use guestfs_safe_strdup and
	guestfs_safe_memdup we need to export those two (in the private

	Previously, optional arguments had the same type as regular arguments, but were

	type.

	A convenience function, optargs_to_args is defined to convert optargs in the few
	places where they are genuinely treated identically to mandatory arguments.

	It also allows for future changes to optional arguments which do not affect
	mandatory arguments.

	Security: Mitigate possible privilege escalation via SG_IO ioctl (CVE-2011-4127, RHBZ#757071)
	CVE-2011-4127 is a serious qemu & kernel privilege escalation bug
	found by Paolo Bonzini.

	http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/536

	An untrusted guest kernel is able to issue special SG_IO ioctls on
	virtio devices which qemu passes through to the host kernel without
	filtering or sanitizing.  These ioctls allow raw sectors from the
	underlying host device to be read and written.  Significantly, neither
	qemu nor the host kernel checks that the range of sectors is within
	the partition / LV assigned to the guest.  For example, if the guest
	is assigned host partition /dev/sda3, it would be able to read or
	write any part of /dev/sda including other partitions and the boot
	sector.  Exploits through LVs passed to the guest are also possible,
	with some limitations.  File-backed virtual block devices are not
	vulnerable.  Non-virtio block devices are not vulnerable.

	This patch mitigates the problem by disabling the SG_IO ioctl
	passthrough in qemu.  Thus if libguestfs is examining an untrusted
	guest and the libguestfs appliance/daemon is compromised (eg. by
	executing guest commands, or through some other compromise), then the
	compromised appliance will not be able to issue the above SG_IO ioctls
	and exploit the host.

	Note that this is just mitigation for libguestfs.  Users will still
	want to fully update their host kernel, qemu/KVM and libvirt, in order
	to prevent other (non-libguestfs) routes to compromise.

	The following versions of libguestfs (will/have) this patch applied.

	  libguestfs >= 1.15.13
	  libguestfs >= 1.14.8
	  libguestfs >= 1.12.11
	  libguestfs >= 1.10.12
	  libguestfs >= 1.8.16

	Earlier versions may be vulnerable unless a downstream packager has
	applied this patch.

	daemon: Fix utimens so it doesn't hang on named pipes (RHBZ#761460).
	This also adds comprehensive tests for utimens on regular files,
	directories (RHBZ#761451), named pipes (RHBZ#761460), symbolic links,
	block and char devices.

	Note that there is a small change in the (previously undefined)

	itself, not on what the symbolic link points to.

2011-12-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Allow utimens to work for directories (RHBZ#761451).

	daemon: Use pkg-config to locate Augeas CFLAGS / libraries.
	Augeas 0.10 depends on libxml2, so this is now required in the
	appliance (in fact, it was already present).

	However this exposed two bugs:

	(1) In libguestfs we use a home-brewed recipe for Augeas flags,
	resulting in this error:
	/usr/include/augeas.h:24:25: fatal error: libxml/tree.h: No such file or directory

	(2) Augeas's own augeas.pc didn't include the libxml2 flags, so
	it was broken.  This requires a patch to Augeas 0.10, see:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/augeas-devel/2011-December/msg00008.html

	Change to using pkg-config to detect Augeas.  It is still an optional

2011-12-02  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	inspection: Handle MD devices in fstab
	This patch fixes inspection when fstab contains devices md devices
	specified as /dev/mdN. The appliance creates these devices without reference to
	the guest's mdadm.conf so, for e.g. /dev/md0 in the guest will often be created
	as /dev/md127 in the appliance. With this patch, we match the uuids of detected
	md devices against uuids specified in mdadm.conf, and map them appropriately
	when we encounter them in fstab.

	build: Add more suppressions for valgrind tests

	Rename mdadm_ apis to md_
	This change renames the following 2 apis:
	* mdadm_create -> md_create
	* mdadm_detail -> md_detail

	This is more consistent with list_md_devices, and removes a reference to an
	implementation detail from the api.

2011-11-24  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	NFC: Allow multiple config files in inspect_with_augeas in inspect_fs_unix.c
	This change is in support of the addition of MD support to fstab inspection.

	NFC: Consolidate the error path in check_fstab in inspect_fs_unix.c

	md: Inspect MD devices

	NFC: Declare and use variables on the same line in inspect.c

	build: Nothing under images/ should be translated

	build: Create an MD variant of the dummy Fedora image
	This change involves rewriting make-fedora-img.sh in perl. This allows the
	flexibility to write mdadm.conf containing whichever uuids where randomly
	generated when the md devices were created.

	run script: Don't overwrite LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PERL5LIB
	This change allows the run scripts of virt-v2v and libguestfs to be chained.

	New API: Bind the tune2fs command.
	Previously we bound the 'tune2fs -l' command so that we could list out
	the tunables of an ext2/3/4 filesystem.  Also commands like
	set_e2label and set_e2uuid used tune2fs.

	This commit binds many of the tunables that can be set using tune2fs.

	The coverage is not complete, but we can add more later because this
	uses optional parameters so the call is extensible without breaking
	ABI.  The current change gives us enough for using libguestfs within
	OpenStack.

2011-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tune2fs-l: Add a test.

	generator: Support testing the output of RHashtable functions.

2011-11-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.15.3.

	functions.

2011-11-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tests: Fix bitmask parameter when testing optional arguments.
	The bitmask was being constructed backwards(!)

	As a result, any test which tested optional arguments didn't work.
	There are very few such tests and they happened not to be affected by
	this.

	Update FSF address.

2011-11-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Use a private copy of /etc/lvm so we don't modify the real config.
	In the libguestfs live case we need to be careful not to modify the
	real /etc/lvm/lvm.conf file (when setting the filter rule).

	When the daemon starts, make a complete copy of /etc/lvm in a
	temporary directory, and adjust LVM_SYSTEM_DIR to point to the copy.
	All changes are made in the temporary copy.

2011-11-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Don't use files with fixed names in /tmp (thanks Steve Kemp).
	Although this doesn't matter for the ordinary (appliance) case, it
	matters for the libguestfs live case.  In that case it could cause the
	guest to be exploited by a tmp/symlink attack.

2011-11-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.15.2.

	virt-sysprep: Don't use xmlstarlet.

2011-11-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add virt-inspector --xpath to run XPath queries directly.
	xmlstarlet is good, but not available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

	Build a simple but sane XPath query parser into virt-inspector
	directly so that we don't need any external tools.

2011-11-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize: Remove requirement for ocaml Pcre library.
	This library is not available in RHEL 6, and in any case removing the

2011-11-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	python: Use sys.version_info[0] instead of sys.version_info.major.
	The major/minor fields only exist in Python >= 2.7.  This works for at
	least Python 2.5 and 2.6.

	Thanks to Hilko Bengen.

2011-11-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	python: Fixes for Python 3 (RHBZ#750889).
	These fixes allow libguestfs bindings to work with Python 3 (tested
	with Python 3.2)

	You can select which Python you compile against by doing:

	  PYTHON=python ./configure && make && make check

	or:

	  PYTHON=python3 ./configure && make && make check

2011-11-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	python: Pass $PYTHON environment variable to tests.
	If the user set PYTHON when configuring, this variable is not passed
	through to the tests, so it is possible the tests will fail because
	they are testing the wrong version of python.  By passing $PYTHON
	through to the tests we ensure that we test against the same version
	of python that we configured with.

	python: Include <config.h>.
	Ooops ...

2011-11-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	python: Correctly check for Python major/minor.
	The manual for sys.version warns that you should not parse the string,
	which we were doing.  It would have failed on python "2.10" or
	similar.

	Do it correctly using the sys.version_info struct instead.

	self-contained HTML page with a handful images that can be easily
	distributed before the talk.

	rescue: Add --suggest option to suggest mount commands.

	fish: Use size_t instead of int when counting strings.

2011-10-31  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Fix debug help error message.
	When given an invalid debug command, libguestfs responds with the
	error message:

	  libguestfs: error: debug: use 'debug help' to list the supported commands

	However this command does not work, as debug requires two
	arguments. This change updates the message to prompt the user to use
	'debug help 0'.

2011-10-31  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Add 'mdadm' package.

2011-10-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Add %guestfs_introspection hash with introspection information.
	Because this is a useful introspection API, it is a candidate for
	being backported into older stable branches.

2011-10-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.15.0.

	Pull latest translations from Transifex.

	generator: Remove DangerWillRobinson.
	This warning was applied unevenly.  Potentially any command can be
	dangerous or safe, so it was a needless warning.

	fuse: Skip guestmount test if setfacl is not installed.
	This dependency is optional, don't fail the test if it's not
	installed.

	virt-sysprep: Skip test if xmlstarlet is not installed.
	This dependency is optional, so don't fail the test if it
	is not installed.

	virt-alignment-scan: Add additional data for 4K sector drives (thanks Matt Booth).

	test-virt-sparsify: Relax size_after constraint (for Debian).
	size_after on Debian was 10136K.  The host filesystem was ext3 (vs
	ext4 for Fedora where we did the original testing).  Probably indirect
	blocks (vs more efficient extents on ext4) causes the difference,
	although I did not look at it in detail.

	Update RELEASE-NOTES for 1.14 release.

	Update ROADMAP for 1.14 release.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update API support.

	Version 1.13.26.

	guestmount: Fix --live option (RHBZ#744795).

	fish and other tools: -d option uses readonlydisk="read" (RHBZ#747290).
	Tools like virt-edit would not be able to edit disks marked as
	<readonly/> in the libvirt XML.  It's not clear if this is a bug or a
	feature.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	add-domain: Add readonlydisk optional argument (RHBZ#747290).
	This optional argument controls how <readonly/> disks in
	the libvirt XML are handled.  It can be set to one of:

	  "write" (default) - add them R/W
	  "read" - add them R/O
	  "error" - throw an error if asked to add them R/W
	  "ignore" - ignore these disks

	I have added limited regression tests for this feature.  However
	libvirt's test:/// XML does not allow you to specify that a domain
	starts off shut down, so we cannot fully test this.  Instead I tested
	it by hand.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	libvirt: Detect if a disk has the <readonly/> flag.
	This changes the private function guestfs___for_each_disk so that the
	<readonly/> flag on libvirt disks is detected and passed through to
	the callback function.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	test-user-cancel: Make this test choose smaller cancellation numbers.
	Use a Gaussian distribution for random numbers so that smaller numbers
	are chosen more frequently.

	This also exposes a bug in this test which only happens when small
	numbers are chosen:

	If the test thread starts up quickly, it can get to
	guestfs_user_cancel before the guestfs_upload command has happened in
	the main thread.  This causes the cancel to be ignored (correctly) and
	we end up in the second loop writing data until the disk runs out of
	space.  Fix this by repeatedly asserting the cancel flag in the second
	loop.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.25.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-resize: Be much more conservative about moving first partition.
	Commit 2910413850c7d9e8df753afad179e415f0638d6d caused Windows 7
	resizes to break with the 0xc0000225 boot error.

	Change the --align-first auto (default) option so that it is more
	conservative about when it moves the first partition.  In particular
	it doesn't move it if it's already aligned (as it is for Win7), nor if
	there is more than one partition (also Win7).

	Tested with: Windows XP, 2003, 7, Ubuntu 10.10 and RHEL 5.

2011-10-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Flush stdout for progress bars used by guestfish, virt-resize.

	virt-resize: Handle extended and logical partitions (RHBZ#642821).

	resize: Get the partition table type of the source disk earlier.
	Also we only permit MBR (DOS) and GPT partition tables.  In theory
	previously we allowed other partition table types, but it is unlikely
	that it would have worked in reality.

	New APIs: copy-{file,device}-to-{file,device}.
	The four new APIs:
	guestfs_copy_device_to_device,
	guestfs_copy_device_to_file,
	guestfs_copy_file_to_device, and
	guestfs_copy_file_to_file
	let you copy from a source to a destination, between files and
	devices, optionally allowing source and destination offsets and size
	to be specified.

2011-10-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ocaml: Make sure virt-resize, virt-sparsify are rebuilt if Guestfs API changes.
	Add a dependency so these tools are rebuilt from scratch if the
	Guestfs API changes.  This prevents the error:
	"[...] make inconsistent assumptions over interface Guestfs".

	This commit includes the generated changes to .depend files.

2011-10-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-filesystems: Add MBR partition type byte to the output.
	This adds an extra column containing this information, looking
	like this:

	Name       Type        VFS   Label  MBR  Size  Parent
	/dev/sda1  filesystem  ntfs  -      -    6.0G  -
	/dev/sda1  partition   -     -      07   6.0G  /dev/sda
	/dev/sda   device      -     -      -    6.0G  -

	In particular you can use this to tell if a partition is an extended
	partition, because the field will contain '05' or '0f'.

2011-10-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: part-to-partnum
	This converts a partition device name (eg. /dev/sda1) to a partition
	number (eg. 1).  This is useful in conjunction with the parted APIs
	that mostly take a disk device + partnum.

	virt-cat: Handle Windows paths and drive letters (RHBZ#693359).

2011-10-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.24.

2011-10-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add test for qemu broken -machine option (RHBZ#748266).
	Also add this option, if necessary, when testing for virtio-serial
	support.

	When the workaround is enabled, we specify machine type 'pc'.

2011-10-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Revert "out-of-tree build: daemon"
	This reverts commit 025dba7f803419f510fd8f085ce693838af82878.

	If build and source directories are the same, you get this error:

	make[3]: Leaving directory `/home/rjones/d/libguestfs/generator'
	make[2]: Circular guestfs_protocol.c <- guestfs_protocol.c dependency dropped.
	make[2]: Circular guestfs_protocol.h <- guestfs_protocol.h dependency dropped.
	rm -f guestfs_protocol.h
	ln  guestfs_protocol.h
	ln: accessing `guestfs_protocol.h': No such file or directory

2011-10-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-win-reg: Document syntax for deleting keys and values (RHBZ#737944).
	NB: This requires hivex >= 1.3.2 before this syntax becomes true.

	virt-make-fs: Refresh man page.

2011-10-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix ./configure --disable-erlang.

2011-10-21  Hilko Bengen  <bengen@hilluzination.de>

	out-of-tree build: fixed bindtests and inspector

	out-of-tree build: fix HAVE_OCAML=false case

	out-of-tree build: daemon

2011-10-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	add-drive-opts: Correctly handle unreadable and unwritable files (RHBZ#747287).

	virt-make-fs: Set MBR partition type byte correctly (RHBZ#746295).

	lib: Common code for formatting the qemu -drive parameter.
	This is just code refactoring.

	Allow compilation without hivex (RHBZ#723474).

	po-docs: Force make update-po on first build from git.

2011-10-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.23.

	appliance: udev-174 moves udevd to /lib/udev/udevd (instead of /sbin/udevd)

	resize: Add --align-first auto|never|always option.
	The first partition can now be aligned.  We fix the bootloader
	correctly for Windows by adjusting the "Hidden Sectors" field.

	resize: Add --alignment flag to allow partition alignment to be picked.

2011-10-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize: Refactor the code for creating target partitions.
	The old code mixed the business of planning the layout of the target
	partitions with the creation of the target partitions.  The
	replacement code separates these into two tasks: firstly we create a
	new 'partitions' list with the target layout, secondly this directly
	drives the creation of the partitions.

	As part of this change I have *removed* the old code that was supposed
	to handle extended/logical MBR partitions.  It simply didn't work, and
	didn't have any hope of working, and there is a separate bug open to
	fix it.

2011-10-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize: Remove p_size field from partitions structure.
	This field simply contained a duplicate copy of p_part.part_size.

	There is no functional change in this commit.

2011-10-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update RELEASE-NOTES.

2011-10-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.22.

2011-10-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Pushed and pulled latest translations from Transifex.
	Fixed one bug in the nl PO file:

	msgid "security: cached appliance %s is not owned by UID %d"
	msgstr "beveiliging: UID %d is geen eigenaar van toepassing %s in cache"

	should be:

	msgid "security: cached appliance %s is not owned by UID %d"
	msgstr "beveiliging: UID %2$d is geen eigenaar van toepassing %1$s in cache"

2011-10-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspection: Return root devices sorted.

2011-10-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	inspect: Handle cciss devices in /etc/fstab

2011-10-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	inspect: Don't assume number of captures in match functions
	It is possible for the pcre library to return a variable number of captures for
	a single regular expression. e.g.:

	  ^/dev/(cciss/c\d+d\d+)(?:p(\d+))?$

	This will return either 1 or 2 captures depending on whether the device has a
	partition suffix. The current match wrappers don't allow for this, and require
	that a predictable number of matches are returned.

	This change updates match, match1, match2, and match3 to ignore the specific
	number of matches returned. Instead, any returned captures are assigned to the
	given arguments, and any remaining arguments are set to NULL.

2011-10-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	inspect: Add drive naming hints
	We currently use a heuristic to guess how drive names we find
	referenced in the guest map to drive names in the appliance. If this
	heuristic fails it can cause inspection to fail.

	This change adds a new 'name' option to add_drive_opts, which allows
	the user to explicitly pass the name of a drive to libguestfs if it is
	known. This change also updates the fstab-parsing inspection code to
	use this information if it is available.

2011-10-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	NFC: Remove unnecessary goto

2011-10-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	launch: Store drive information in guestfs_h
	This is a NFC on its own, but provides a place-holder for drive metadata which
	can be used after launch.

	Fixes by RWMJ:

	 - Fix the tests: this requires a new internal function 'debug-drives'
	   that dumps out the g->drives information so it can be checked in
	   two of the tests.  Previously these tests used 'debug-cmdline'.

	 - Test file existence / use_cache_off in the add_drive_opts function,
	   not when launching qemu in the child process.

	 - Call free along error paths.

	 - Add comments.

2011-10-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	inspect: Fix fstab device mapping for >26 disks
	The regular expression matching disk name assumed that there was only a single
	letter suffix. This change handles a naming scheme for any number of disks.

2011-10-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	launch: Ensure g->cmdline is allocated before assigning g->cmdline[0].

	valgrind: guestfish -i: free strings before exit.
	This isn't really necessary, but it keeps valgrind happy.

2011-10-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Ubuntu 11.10: Create /run and /run/lock if not already.
	In real machines these directories are a ramdisk.

2011-10-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-sysprep: Fix link in documentation.

	Skip guestmount and virt-sysprep tests if no /dev/fuse.

2011-10-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-sysprep: Fix test to use guestmount and virt-inspector binaries that have been built.

2011-10-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Fedora cryptsetup-luks renamed to cryptsetup.
	Therefore we need both names to be listed in the file.

	roadmap: Fix Bugzilla URL.

	More TODO items.

	Update RELEASE-NOTES file.

	Version 1.13.21.

2011-10-14  Erik Nolte  <erik_nolte@acm.org>

	Use ArchLinux's new kernel package "linux".

2011-10-14  Michael Scherer  <misc@zarb.org>

	Add basic support for netbsd detection.

	Add support for pkgsrc, default NetBSD package manager.
	For now, only detect the tool, but support from reading
	installed package could be added later ( may require either
	a package of pkgsrc, or a smaller tool to read the db ).

	Add support for mounting ufs from NetBSD, and fix FreeBSD detection on Fedora 16
	While testing on Fedora 16, I noticed that Linux will mount the disk
	without trouble by using automatically ufstype=old, and yet do not
	let us read the directories. So we should start directly with usftype=ufs2,
	and if it fail, try 44bsd, as used for netbsd and openbsd ( as seen on
	http://wiki-static.aydogan.net/How_to_mount_FFS_partition_under_Linux ).

	Add the Opensuse logo ( thanks to Vincent Untz )
	Like Ubuntu one, it may not be always present.

	Add Opensuse and zypper detection support
	This would also erronously detect SLES as Opensuse.

	Add support for Ubuntu logo
	Ths logo is present on Lucid Lynx, but may not always be installed, like
	in case of a minimal installation ( or server ). While Edubuntu and Kubuntu
	have different logo, I didn't check where it would be placed.

	Detect Mageia distribution

	Partially fix --disable-erlang
	Without this, configure will always enable erlang, no matter what
	argument are passed. Now, we can disable it, even if configure still
	need the erlang compiler for some obscure reason.

2011-10-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-sysprep: Add cron-spool, mail-spool, utmp.

2011-10-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-sysprep: Use /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random.

	virt-sysprep: More clarifications to the man page.

	virt-sysprep: Clarify docs on enabling operations.

	virt-sysprep: Add rhn-systemid.

2011-10-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-sysprep: Switch to using guestmount, add more features.
	This switches virt-sysprep to use guestmount instead of guestfish.
	This makes the script a little bit easier to modify for sysadmins.

	This commit also adds:

	 - dhcp-client-state
	 - dhcp-server-state
	 - logfiles
	 - random-seed
	 - smolt-uuid
	 - yum-uuid

	SELinux relabelling, and a section on security in the manual page.

2011-10-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-sysprep: Use Augeas for config file manipulation.

	virt-sysprep: Add prepend_line utility function.

2011-10-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: docs: note how to clean up the remote process properly.
	Killing it is always a bad idea, because the qemu subprocess will be
	left hanging around.  The best thing is to send the exit command.

	This also makes the change to virt-sysprep.

2011-10-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Close guestfs handle explicitly before exiting.
	NOTE this is just a cleanup.  It is NOT necessary for correctness,
	since libguestfs itself is correctly closing the handle in the exit
	handler.

	virt-sysprep: Trap ERR as well as EXIT.

	guestmount: Add note to man page about 'fuse' group for Debian.

	virt-sysprep: Simplify calls to guestfish --remote.

	virt-sysprep: Further TODO items (thanks Nikita Menkovich).

	virt-sysprep: Further TODO items (thanks Marko Myllynen, James Antill).

2011-10-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.20.

	virt-sysprep: Update TODO list again.

	virt-sysprep: Update TODO list (thanks Steve Grubb, Dan Berrange).

2011-10-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	TODO: More virt-sysprep suggestions (thanks librarian).

	Add systemtap/DTrace probes.
	Mainly this is a documentation change.  However a sample of
	DTrace-compatible userspace probes are also added.

	Update TODO file with future plans for virt-sysprep.

2011-10-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.19.

	New tool: virt-sysprep: system preparation for guests.

2011-10-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Add man page section on calling guestfish remote robustly from bash.

	virt-alignment-scan: Fix SYNOPSIS in manual page.

	Makefile.am: Fix comment.

2011-10-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-alignment-scan: docs: Add link to RHEL Storage Administration Guide.

	virt-alignment-scan: More information in man page.
	Thanks Mike Snitzer.

	virt-resize: Align partitions to multiple of 128 sectors (instead of 64).
	This gives us effectively 64 KByte alignment, optimal for all current
	types of storage.

2011-10-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update RELEASE-NOTES file.

	Version 1.13.18.

	New tool: virt-alignment-scan to check alignment of partitions.

	docs: Add directory sections for resize/ and sparsify/

2011-10-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update RELEASE-NOTES file.

	sparsify: Fix --ignore option to work on canonical device names.

	docs: Clearer language in virt-sparsify man page.

	Version 1.13.17.

	New tool: virt-sparsify to make disk images sparse.

	docs: Add virt-resize to list of links in guestfs(3).

	docs: virt-win-reg is written in Perl, not virt-resize.

	Update API support documentation.

2011-10-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.16.

	mount: Not deprecated any more.
	This updates commit 5c2f1a2d9433eeb5aebeec26f0412c703bbe7269.

	mount: No longer implicitly add -o sync,noatime options.

2011-09-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: mkswap --help output changed, breaking linuxfsuuid group detection.

2011-09-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.15.

2011-09-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: set-smp, get-smp
	These calls allow you to change the number of virtual CPUs assigned to
	the appliance.

	This also adds a --smp option to virt-rescue.

2011-09-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: compress-out, compress-device-out.
	These APIs let you copy compressed files or devices out from the disk
	image.

	Compression is useful for large images which are mostly zeroes.  We
	cannot currently do sparseness detection, and compression gives us a
	form of zero detection for free.

	Example usage:

	$ guestfish --ro -a /dev/vg_pin/F16x64 -i \
	    compress-out gzip /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.gz
	$ file -z /tmp/passwd.gz
	/tmp/passwd.gz: ASCII text (gzip compressed data, was "passwd", from
	Unix, last modified: Sun Aug 28 14:40:46 2011)

2011-09-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Move useful is_zero function to header file.
	Code motion.

2011-09-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add no_timer_check to disable faulty test during boot (RHBZ#502058).
	See:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=502058#c15
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698842#c8

	This updates commit 79e66f89e2f6c27486476d7857da58feb491bf5c.

2011-09-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Show how to use a qemu wrapper to edit the qemu command line.

2011-09-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.14.

	Update to latest gnulib.

2011-09-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	erlang: Use the official autoconf macros.

2011-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: Suggestion to improve Erlang bindings.

2011-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Enable APIC.
	Originally this was disabled to work around RHBZ#502058.  That bug was
	never officially fixed, but it may have fixed itself.

	In the meantime, KVM has broken ordinary PIC support (RHBZ#723822).
	Since APIC is the most common way that regular Linux and Windows
	guests run it makes sense to remove this hack.

2011-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.13.

	Add Erlang bindings.

2011-09-16  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspection: Handle /dev/root in /etc/fstab.
	This means "the device that holds /etc/fstab", so map it correctly.

	This fixes support for ttylinux and also some other guests that use
	/dev/root instead of a real device name.

2011-09-16  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspection: Add support for ttylinux (a minimal Linux).

2011-09-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add an optional group ("grub") for the guestfs_grub_install API.
	This also improves the documentation for this call, pointing out
	several pitfalls in using it.

	This unfortunately breaks existing callers that might use
	guestfs_grub_install without checking for this new group.

2011-09-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.12.

	test-tool: Display TMPDIR.

	test-tool: Refresh libguestfs-test-tool man page.

	test-tool: Make the default timeout be 600 seconds (10 minutes).
	We could sometimes hit the 120 second timeout, eg. if the appliance
	needed to be rebuilt and the machine was very slow and/or under heavy
	I/O load.  10 minutes should be enough for any reasonable situation.

	test-tool: Document the -t command line option.

	test-tool: Use B<...> for command line options in man page.

2011-09-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	po-docs: Make podfiles sort stable.

	Stable OCaml dependencies.

2011-09-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Add a section explaining the appliance boot process.

2011-09-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.11.

	Remove old regression test that mainly tested a buggy API.
	The guestfs_ll command currently lists files in the appliance if you
	prefix filenames with "/..".  However this is a bug, not a feature,
	and we should not be testing it.

	debian: Missing build dependency on db4.8-util.

	daemon: Factor out name of virtio serial channel.
	This is just code motion.

	Create /sys directory if it doesn't exist already.
	Ubuntu 10.04 LTS packages don't create /sys.

2011-08-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.10.

	cat: Small documentation correction.

2011-08-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspector: Use xmlstarlet instead of xpath in examples.

	man pages: Add a standard EXIT STATUS section to most pages.

2011-08-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.9.

	progress: Make default UTF-8 progress bar less black.

	resize: Add --machine-readable option for machine friendly output.

2011-08-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	progress: Add machine readable flag.
	Machine-readable progress bars look like:

	0/100
	1/100
	2/100

2011-08-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize: Use guestfish progress bar mini-library.
	There are two benefits:

	 - the progress bars look better
	 - there is a reasonably accurate estimate of how long each operation
	   will take

2011-08-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add GUESTFS_EVENT_ENTER event.
	This event is generated whenever a libguestfs function is called.

	fish: Make progress bars into a mini library.
	This library could now be called from other virt tools.

	fish: clarify comment: shared source files are used by virt tools too.

	Version 1.13.8.

	ruby: Check Ruby callback exists before we call it (RHBZ#733297).

2011-08-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ruby: Use a regular C array to pass the arguments through rb_rescue.

	ruby: Append newline character after printing exception in callback.

2011-08-24  Hilko Bengen  <bengen@hilluzination.de>

	python: Newer versions want parentheses around arguments of "print"

	python: Don't build static library

	Version 1.13.7.

2011-08-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	php: Fix bug in PHP tests.
	We partitioned the disk, and then tried to create a PV on the whole
	disk.  LVM gave the error:

	  Device /dev/vda not found (or ignored by filtering).

	It is unclear how this bug persisted for so long.  It might be due to
	a change in LVM.

2011-08-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Coverity: fix memory leak along error path.

	Coverity: Initialize msg buffer.
	msg_flags was not being initialized and would have been passed to
	sendmsg with a random value.

	Coverity: fix memory leak in guestfish.

	Coverity: in daemon, free struct in RStruct, RStructList functions.

	pclose: Fix other places where we only tested pclose == -1.
	pclose can return > 0 when the status of the command was non-zero.

	test_qemu: Improve the error message.
	Note that errno is probably not set to a useful value here, so there
	is not much point recording it.

	test_qemu: pclose may return any != 0 on error.
	In particular pclose returns a status > 0 if the command fails.

	qemu detection: Free up previous qemu help/version strings if they exist.

	Coverity: test_qemu: Ensure FILE * is not leaked along error paths.
	This refactors the code in test_qemu slightly to ensure that
	FILE *fp is not leaked on error paths.

	Coverity: Check guestfs_inspect_get_product_name() != NULL before using.

2011-08-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	rescue: Ignore errno after guestfs_launch.
	errno is pretty much random on the error path back from guestfs_launch
	so there is nothing useful to be gained by checking it.

	We could do with a better way to detect if appliance launch failed.

2011-08-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Coverity: Ignore return value from guestfs_launch in virt-rescue.
	We expect guestfs_launch to fail in this program.

	Coverity: Check return value from sscanf in bindtests calls.

2011-08-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	autobuild: Only add last 100 lines of the log file.

2011-08-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New autobuild script.
	Remove the old top-level autobuild.sh that confused a lot
	of people.

	Add an autobuild.sh script that builds from the latest tarball.

2011-08-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	configure: Add --with-extra flag to allow setting the extra version string.
	Intended use in Fedora and RHEL is to encode the release
	string, eg.

	  ./configure [...] --with-extra="-%{release}"

2011-08-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.6.

2011-08-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	protocol: Fix case where download can fail for small files.
	There is another case where downloads of small files could fail if the
	library side (writer) fails.  In this case the library would send back
	a cancellation, but it would be received after the daemon had finished
	sending the whole file (because the file is small enough).  The daemon
	would reenter the main loop and immediately get an unexpected cancel
	message, causing the daemon to die.

	This commit also makes test-cancellation-download-librarycancels.sh
	more robust.  We use Monte-Carlo testing with a range of file sizes.
	Small file sizes should trigger the error case.

2011-08-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Escape special/non-printing characters in debug output (RHBZ#731744).
	The default event handler in libguestfs was simply writing all debug
	output directly to stderr.  However if the output contains
	non-printable characters such as terminal control codes then these
	would also be sent directly.

	With newer SeaBIOS there is a lame attempt to implement a splash
	screen using terminal control codes, thus when libguestfs tries to
	display debugging output it would cause the screen to clear and debug
	output to be lost.

	This commit causes all non-printing characters to be escaped.
	(\n and \r characters from the appliance are treated somewhat
	specially).

	Furthermore, instead of using write(2), use buffered stderr calls.

2011-08-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove guestfs___print_timestamped_argv.
	This function was used to print the qemu and
	febootstrap-supermin-helper command lines.

	Unfortunately in the qemu case it was used incorrectly: it called the
	internal debug function (ie. event API callback) from the forked qemu
	subprocess, which meant that higher level event callbacks might have
	been invoked from the child process.

	To fix this, convert the qemu case into a new function called
	print_qemu_command line which just prints the command line directly to
	stderr.  This is called after stderr has been redirected into the pipe
	to the main process.  Thus the qemu command line will be marshalled
	into the event API along with other qemu and appliance output.

	After fixing this, only one use of guestfs___print_timestamped_argv
	remained, for printing the febootstrap-supermin-helper command line.
	This is converted to a local function print_febootstrap_command_line.

	Also print_febootstrap_command_line is now called before we fork
	febootstrap-supermin-helper, so that messages no longer overlap.

2011-08-18  Hilko Bengen  <bengen@hilluzination.de>

	out-of-tree build: generate ./run from template, fix image checks
	./run can now be run in a separate build directory. Since some files
	needed in the image checks are found in the source tree (but not the
	build tree), the source tree location is passed to make-*-img.sh via
	an environment variable.

2011-08-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.13.5

	fish: Add fish-cmds.h to generator_built.
	This updates commit 3064277680ad11f887691646d0fa17bb35f38c19.

2011-08-17  Hilko Bengen  <bengen@hilluzination.de>

	out-of-tree build: fix make and make install
	$(srcdir) is not needed for guestfs_c.c.
	*.mli only exists in $(srcdir) and isn't found on "make install" otherwise

	out-of-tree build: fix documentation generation II

	out-of-tree build: remove unneeded explicit paths

2011-08-16  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Improve zeroing and detection of zeroes.
	This code modifies zero, zero-device, is-zero, is-zero-device.

	zero and zero-device are modified so that if the blocks of the device
	already contain zeroes, then we don't write zeroes.  The reason for
	this is to avoid unnecessarily making the underlying storage
	non-sparse or (in the qcow2 case) growing it.

	is-zero and is-zero-device are modified so that zero detection is
	faster.  This is a nice side effect of making the first change.

	Since avoiding unnecessary zeroing involves reading the blocks before
	writing them, whereas before we just blindly wrote, this can be
	slower.  As you can see from the tests below, in the case where the
	disk is sparse, it actually turns out to be faster, because we avoid
	allocating the underlying blocks.

	However in the case where the disk is non-sparse and full of existing
	data, it is much slower.  There might be a case for an API flag to
	adjust whether or not we perform the zero check.  I did not add this
	flag because it is unlikely that the caller would have enough
	information to be able to set the flag correctly.

	                                (Elapsed time in seconds)
	Format  Test case                 Before     After

	Raw     Sparse                    16.4       5.3

	        Preallocated zero         17.0       18.8

	        Preallocated random       16.0       41.3

	Qcow2   preallocation=off         18.7       5.6

	        preallocation=metadata    17.4       5.8

	The current code uses a fixed block size of 4K for reading and
	writing.  I also tried the same tests with a block size of 64K but it
	didn't make any significant difference.

	(Thanks to Federico Simoncelli for suggesting this change)

	Fix 'unknown filesystem' warnings in old inspection code (RHBZ#678231 RHBZ#666578).
	This is a comprehensive fix for the warnings from the old (and
	obsolete) Perl inspection code.  For a full description and
	reproducer, see:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678231#c5

2011-08-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspection: Better checking for Windows root disks (RHBZ#729075).
	Previously any disk that had /autoexec.bat or /boot.ini or /ntldr
	would be picked up as a candidate for a Windows root disk.  If further
	checking could not find any systemroot (eg. /windows) then this would
	result in complete failure of inspection.

	In particular, this got confused by Hp_recovery partitions which have
	/autoexec.bat, but don't have a systemroot in one of the usual places
	(they have /MiniNT instead).

	What we do now is to properly investigate all possible systemroot
	places before deciding this is a Windows systemroot, so the subsequent
	failure cannot occur.

	(Thanks to lorimar for reporting this bug).

2011-08-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Print input file and line number in error messages.
	eg:
	*stdin*:37: libguestfs: error: luks_close: Device lukstest is busy.

	gnulib: Add all other libs when linking libguestfs.so.
	This updates the previous two commits.

	gnulib: Add $(LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME) when linking libguestfs.so.
	We don't use this library (it is only used in the daemon),
	but we need to add this to make the linker happy.

2011-08-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Remove separate configure of daemon subdirectory.
	Combine the two Gnulib instances together.

	Add checks from old daemon/configure.ac into configure.ac.

	Fix daemon/Makefile.am so it is like a normal subdirectory
	Makefile.am.

	Because we are now using the replacement strerror_r function from
	Gnulib (instead of the one from glibc directly), this requires a small
	change to src/guestfs.c.

2011-08-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Fix CCFLAGS for Perl 5.14.
	A change to ExtUtils::CBuilder in Perl 5.14 causes CCFLAGS to
	completely replace, rather than appending, the C flags.

	The unfortunate consequence of this is that vital flags such as
	-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 are missing.  For 32 bit code, this means you
	get binary-incompatible code that completely fails to load.

	For further analysis see:

	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2011/04/msg171535.html

	This commit changes CCFLAGS so that it appends to the existing
	$Config{ccflags} instead of replacing it.  On earlier versions of Perl
	this means we get two copies of the flags, which is unfortunate but
	should be safe.

	Finalize release notes for 1.12 release.

	blkid: Use -c /dev/null option to kill the cache.
	On recent Debian, /etc/blkid.tab is now a symlink to /dev/.blkid.tab.
	Rather than chasing the cache file around (it may move to /run in future)
	use the -c /dev/null option to stop blkid from reading the cache.

2011-07-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	blkid: Detect when value not found and return empty string.
	If the blkid command returns 2, that means the value was not found.

	Note that this changes the output of the vfs-type API when the
	filesystem has no type (eg when it is empty).  Previously this would
	return an error.  Now it returns empty string "".

	We did not document this either way.  Making it return empty string is
	consistent with vfs-label and vfs-uuid.

	This change broke list-filesystems, since that code was assuming that
	vfs-type could only return a filesystem type or an error.

2011-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix test-guestfish-escapes regression test to work with debug/trace enabled.
	If debugging or tracing is enabled, extra messages are sent to stderr
	which mess with this test.  Remove the extra messages before checking
	stderr.

	This updates commit 617e7f6bafa7de2303c08e1715004aae3141c389.

2011-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.18.

	Update release notes.

	Update API support.

	ruby: Add binding for guestfs_user_cancel.

	perl: Add binding for guestfs_user_cancel.

	ocaml: Add binding for guestfs_user_cancel.

	fish: Register ^C handler to cancel long transfers.

	fish: Add is_interactive flag.
	Decide early (before launch) if this is going to be an interactive
	session, and set the is_interactive flag.

2011-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add user cancellation to the C API.
	This allows long transfers (FileIn and FileOut operations) to be
	cancelled by calling the signal and thread safe guestfs_user_cancel
	function.

	Most of this commit consists of a multithreaded program that tests
	user cancellation of uploads and downloads.

2011-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: set-pgroup, get-pgroup
	If the pgroup flag is set in the handle, then the qemu and recovery
	subprocesses are placed in separate process groups.  The default is
	false.

	The purpose for setting up a process group is that ^C will not be
	passed from the main process down to these processes (killing them).
	This allows ^C and other keyboard events to be caught and handled in
	the main process.

2011-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfs.h: Add missing extern keyword before event functions.

2011-07-14  Nikita A Menkovich  <menkovich@gmail.com>

	debian: New sub-package: guestfsd.
	This patch adds guestfsd debian package to the build.  The daemon can
	be installed in virtualization clients to enable libguestfs live
	access.

2011-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: write-append
	Append content to the end of a file.

	fish: Handle backslash escapes in guestfish double-quoted strings.

2011-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	build: Add ./configure --enable-install-daemon
	If enabled, then the daemon will be installed in $sbindir
	(eg. /usr/sbin/guestfsd).  The default is off, as now.

	This option should be used by packagers when building the libguestfs
	live service.

2011-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.17.

	resize: Clarify examples in the man page.

	resize: Add btrfs support to virt-resize (RHBZ#721275).

	New API: btrfs-filesystem-resize (RHBZ#721160).
	This resizes a btrfs filesystem.

	docs: resize: Not just limited to resizing filesystems in partitions.
	If you use --LV-expand then filesystems in LVs can be resized too.

	mkfs: Don't die if mke2fs is not available.
	Allow other types of filesystems to be created.

2011-07-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.16.

	Update release notes.

2011-07-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Refresh README file.
	Update and verify the list of requirements, by checking it against
	both configure.ac and the Fedora specfile.

	Remove some obsolete sections that covered historical ground.

2011-07-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Add systemd to get /sbin/reboot for virt-rescue (RHBZ#661280).

	docs: Update API support.

	virt-resize: Arrange options in man page in alphabetical order.

	virt-resize: Add --ntfsresize-force option.
	Use the non-deprecated g#ntfsresize_opts API call, and also add
	the --ntfsresize-force option for forcing resize.

2011-07-12  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.15.

	TODO: Attach method for disconnected operation.

	part-get-bootable: Fix when partitions are missing or unordered (RHBZ#602997).

	New API: ntfsresize-opts (RHBZ#685009).
	This is a more comprehensive fix for RHBZ#685009.  Add a new API which
	allows the --force flag to be passed, allowing multiple NTFS resize
	operations in a single session.

	Document that ntfsresize cannot be used multiple times (RHBZ#685009).

2011-07-12  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Show device mapper device in tab completion (RHBZ#688062).
	With this change:

	><fs> luks-open /dev/vda1 lukstest
	Enter key or passphrase ("key"):
	><fs> ll /dev/<TAB>
	/dev/mapper/lukstest  /dev/vda              /dev/vda1

2011-07-12  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: list-dm-devices (RHBZ#688062).
	List device mapper devices.

	Don't mention /dev/mapper in docs for vg-activate{,-all} commands.
	Although vg-activate and vg-activate-all do make /dev/mapper/VG-LV
	devices internally, we always prefer to use the /dev/VG/LV format and
	we return this format where possible.  Therefore don't mention
	/dev/mapper in this documentation.

	protocol: Force optargs_bitmask to be passed as 0 for non-opt actions.
	If the action doesn't take optional arguments, nevertheless force the
	optargs_bitmask field in the header to be passed as 0, and give an
	error if not.

	list-9p: Avoid double free along error path.
	This updates commit 5f10c3350338bbca735a74db26f98da968957bd9.

2011-07-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.14.

	mkfs-opts: Don't test optional arguments in this test.

2011-07-06  Nikita A Menkovich  <menkovich@gmail.com>

	mkfs-opts: Add optional sectorsize parameter.

2011-07-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	capitests: Allow tests to properly test optional arguments.
	For optional arguments, you can now specify empty string to mean no
	argument, except for String optional arguments where you must use
	"NOARG" (empty string meaning a supplied empty string argument).

2011-07-04  Nikita A Menkovich  <menkovich@gmail.com>

	Implement inode option to mkfs_opts command.
	This is needed because older versions of grub(for example in centos)
	do not understand filesystems created with newer version of e2fsprogs.
	By default in e2fsprogs 1.4+ creates partitions with 256 bit inode
	size, and grub expect 128 bit size.

2011-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.13.

	Add caution subdirectory containing safety and liveness tests.
	Not that I'm paranoid about qemu breaking snapshots of anything like
	that ...

	Update release notes.

	inspector: Update documentation to cover <icon> element.
	This updates commit 7f16c346bbeba2f2fe3c31ccb85158178a284d84.

	python: Add explicit g.close() method (RHBZ#717786).

2011-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Update API support.

2011-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.12.

	fish: Add 'display' command for displaying graphical files.

2011-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: inspect-get-icon returns the guest icon.
	This API returns the guest's favicon if found, else an icon
	representing the guest operating system.  Currently supported by this
	patch: Fedora, RHEL and derivatives, Debian (but not Ubuntu),
	Windows XP, Windows 7.

	This also updates virt-inspector to include an <icon> element
	containing the icon in base64 encoding.

2011-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change download_to_tmp so it can work with multi-root operating systems.
	The previous guestfs___download_to_tmp function did not handle
	multiboot correctly.  In particular it used the same cache name
	for downloaded files from different roots, which could have caused
	things like applications in each root to be confused.

	This changes the function so that the cache filename is prefixed
	with the root / fs number, eg. $tmpdir/0-Name instead of $tmpdir/Name.

	This change also requires the function to return the new name, so
	all places in the code which called this function had to be
	updated.

	This updates and fixes commit 3c1f762abed92f7a358f3bc93e3396d0606b18ad.

2011-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Fix functions with both RBufferOut and optional args.
	No current function returns RBufferOut and has optional args.  Such
	functions would be generated incorrectly.

	RBufferOut implies a silent "size_t *size_r" argument is added after
	the regular arguments and before the optional arguments.  Various
	changes to the code generator need to be made to take this into
	account.

2011-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspector: Fix comment in virt-inspector.rng.
	The comment referred to the command line syntax of the old
	virt-inspector.

	inspection: Remove note about root device string.
	This is a fairly pointless note/warning since (a) you can't use the
	API if you don't pass a root device string and (b) the code gives you
	a good error message if you pass something that is not a root device
	string.

	guestfs.h: Tidy up *_argv structs and other #defines.

	Revert "Lib.pm: unknown filesystem label SWAP-sda2 (RHBZ#666578)"
	This reverts commit 5cab0d6c807d8a3bf9690375c663d11a10e21656.

2011-06-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: mount-9p lets you mount 9p filesystems (RHBZ#714981).
	The updated patch makes 'options' into an optional parameter.

	New API: list-9p lists 9p filesystem mount tags (RHBZ#714981).

2011-06-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	trace: Print empty list correctly.
	Empty lists returned by RStringList and RHashtable functions
	were incorrectly printed as [""].

	Fix this so they are printed as [] instead.

2011-06-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.11.

2011-06-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Enable deprecated option only with gcc >= 4.5.
	Before gcc 4.5, the deprecated option did not take the optional string
	argument (see [1]).  This caused compilation to fail with gcc < 4.5.

	[1] http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.5/changes.html

2011-06-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Ignore MYMETA.yml.
	This file is created by one of the build tools used by Perl 5.14.

	todo: Idea for interactive disk creator program.

2011-06-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Don't use qw() as parentheses.
	In Perl 5.14:

	Use of qw(...) as parentheses is deprecated at perl/blib/lib/Sys/Guestfs/Lib.pm line 1111.

2011-06-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Rewrite UUIDs that begin with zero byte.
	In util-linux <= 2.19, mkswap -U cannot handle the first byte of the
	UUID being zero, so we artificially rewrite such UUIDs.

	See: http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.utilities.util-linux-ng/4273

2011-06-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.10.

2011-06-10  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	build: include <string.h> for src/match.c's use of strlen

2011-06-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	bootstrap: use --libtool

	build: update to latest gnulib
	* .gnulib: Update submodule to latest.
	* daemon/m4/gnulib-cache.m4: Regenerate.

2011-06-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Keep Coverity happy by ignoring some return values.

2011-06-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Coverity: Don't return freed pointers from command* along error path.
	If the external command failed to run, we could free up the allocated
	*stdoutput and *stderror pointers, but then return those freed
	pointers to the caller.  The caller usually tries to print and free
	*stderror, so this is a serious error.

	Instead, return *stdoutput as NULL, and *stderror pointing to a
	generic error message.

2011-06-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Coverity: Missing return on error path.

	Coverity: Ensure fp is closed along all error paths.

	Coverity: Close directory handle along error paths.

	Coverity: Don't leak argv arrays.

	Coverity: Don't leak error strings.

	Coverity: Check return value of sysroot_path.
	For some reason we were checking the parameter!

	Coverity: Check return value of malloc.

	Coverity: Don't close fd_cwd if fd_cwd == -1.

	Coverity: Avoid calling sort_strings (NULL, 0) on empty list.

	Coverity: Don't call free_strings (NULL).

	Coverity: Remove unreachable code.

2011-06-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	init: Remove timeout in udevadm settle command.
	The given timeout (10s) was too low if the appliance was
	running slowly, which caused a cascade of other failures
	during tests.

	Note that in udev-171 and above on Fedora, /sbin/start_udev
	no longer exists, so now we are using this manual method to
	start udevd.

2011-06-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	protocol: Enhance "unexpected end of file when reading from daemon" error.
	Make this error more informative, since it is a common error when the
	appliance fails to start up.

2011-06-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.9.

	Only include date, not time, in BUGS file.
	This is so the file does not change so often when using 'make dist'.

	Remove dependency diagram, since it is very out of date.

	virt-ls: Add virt-ls -lR option for complex file iteration.

	virt-ls: Refactor mode selection code.
	This is just code motion.

	virt-ls: Small fix for output of --help option.

	Ubuntu: Fix compilation of virt-resize if old libguestfs already installed.

2011-06-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	recipes: in tr command \000 should be \0

2011-05-20  Nikita A Menkovich  <menkovich@gmail.com>

	daemon: Fix error message.

2011-05-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: Document thoughts on visiting files.

2011-05-20  Nikita A Menkovich  <menkovich@gmail.com>

	debian: Add build dependencies: dpkg-dev, devscripts, gperf.

2011-05-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Make sysroot_len be size_t instead of int.

2011-05-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: Remove event log parsing - done.

	build: Install guestfs-recipes.1.html on website.
	This updates commit f2c7df589c7e161f33b46d05a943b5489dc2cffe.

	Add new guestfs-rescue(1) man page with recipes.

	Remove guestfish recipes.
	These were out of date.  We will replace them with more up to date
	information.

	guestfs-examples(3): Remove link to OCaml homepage.

	Version 1.11.8.

	zero: Disable file test because of bug in file command.
	See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=705499

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-win-reg: Win XP paths can contain %systemdrive%.

	virt-win-reg: systemroot macro should be replaced case insensitive.

	New APIs: is-zero and is-zero-device, to test if file or device is all zeroes.

	Document that guestfs_file output depends on file(1) command.
	And therefore practically it cannot be part of the ABI since
	the output of file(1) itself changes from time to time.

	fuse: Add note about allowing other users to see filesystem (RHBZ#705200).

	Version 1.11.7.

	generator: Mark sfdisk functions as deprecated.
	Point to the part-* API calls as replacements.

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Mark mount as deprecated.
	Callers should use 'mount_options' or 'mount_vfs' instead.

	See also:
	http://libguestfs.org/guestfs.3.html#libguestfs_gotchas

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Mark wait_ready as deprecated.
	The function has been a no op for a very long time.  By marking
	it as deprecated we make it clear that you shouldn't call it
	in new code.

	generator: Check the flags fields.

	Enable deprecation warnings on all C programs.

	fish: fuse: Remove redundant -DGUESTFS_DEFAULT_PATH.
	This was left over from earlier code.  It is used in the base library,
	but not in guestfish or guestmount.

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Warn about deprecated functions (enable with -DGUESTFS_WARN_DEPRECATED=1).
	This allows C API users to be warned if they are using any deprecated
	functions.

	We don't warn about this by default.  Users have to specifically
	request this by defining the cpp symbol GUESTFS_WARN_DEPRECATED as 1.

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Add GCC version macro to the header file.
	This will be used to internally enable various GCC enhancements.

	lib: Add vertical space between each function in <guestfs.h>.

	appliance: Use qemu -machine option where available (RHBZ#700369).

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-win-reg: Support HKEY_USERS keys.
	This adds support for various Registry keys under HKEY_USERS (user
	preferences).

	(1) HKEY_USERS\<SID>
	    where <SID> is a User SID.

	For example:

	  # virt-win-reg Windows 'HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-19'

	lists out the LocalService user's registry.

	(2) HKEY_USERS\<username>
	    where <username> is a Windows local username (this is a
	    libguestfs extension).

	For example:

	  # virt-win-reg Windows 'HKEY_USERS\rjones'

	lists out the user preferences of user 'rjones'.

	HKU can be used as an abbreviation for HKEY_USERS.  Merging is also
	supported.

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-win-reg: Don't use implicit $_ in map_path_to_hive function.

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-win-reg: Don't hard-code the relationship between hive name and path.
	The crucial change is the tuple that is returned by map_path_to_hive:

	-    my ($hivename, [...]) = map_path_to_hive ($_);
	+    my ($hiveshortname, $hivefile, [...]) = map_path_to_hive ($_);

	Previously the $hivename was both the name of the hive (eg. "sam"),
	the name of the local copy in /tmp, and the name of the hive in
	%systemroot%\system32\config.

	In the new code, the $hiveshortname (eg. "sam") is still used for the
	local copy in /tmp, but we return $hivefile which is the full Windows
	path (eg. "/windows/system32/config/sam").

	The purpose of this change is to allow us in future to return hives
	from other Windows directories, specifically HKEY_USERS hives from
	Windows home directories.

	Although this is just code motion, it requires some quite extensive
	changes to virt-win-reg.

2011-05-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-win-reg: Add --unsafe-printable-strings option.
	This also requires hivex >= 1.2.7.

2011-05-16  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: See if qemu -machine option can be used to select KVM, TCG acceleration.

2011-05-12  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.6.

	debian: Note that libconfig-dev ought to be required.
	However it doesn't appear to be in Debian at the moment.

	debian: Include debian/ directory in tarball.
	This makes it simpler to build Debian and Ubuntu packages from the
	tarballs.

	build: Sort EXTRA_DIST into lexicographic order.

2011-05-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	configure: Use Python platform-dependent site-packages.
	This updates commit c446e6e26e317e105870b0ab25fb082887e23bf6.

	Version 1.11.5.

	edit: Reorganize options alphabetically.

	edit: Fix reference to virt-cat in the documentation.
	This updates commit 2b5fbc882a0a79646b668c7b95442f0b3673d63a.

	Use Python distutils to determine include and site-packages directories.
	This change was inspired by Hilko Bengen's similar change to hivex:
	http://git.annexia.org/?p=hivex.git;a=commitdiff;h=b808c875a34e62fcdf360534f923d6030590ff44

	Rewrite virt-edit in C.

2011-05-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Remove some less useful debugging messages.
	Remove some debug messages which were basically left over from when
	the code was being developed.

	However we leave debug messages where it is printing an external
	command that is about to be executed, since those are useful.

2011-05-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.11.4.

2011-05-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix guestfs___rollback_cmdline when pos == 0.
	Because of the previous change to size_t, when pos == 0 the loop would
	wrap around and cause a segmentation fault.

	This fixes a regression introduced by
	commit 10167cea98f93a74abe63f0a54d3a662997e7489.

2011-05-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	configure: Sort output files in AC_CONFIG_FILES section.

2011-05-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Allow -d UUID (specify libvirt domains by UUID).
	This applies in all the commands which use the common C option parsing
	code, ie:

	* guestfish
	* guestmount
	* virt-cat
	* virt-df
	* virt-filesystems
	* virt-inspector
	* virt-ls
	* virt-rescue

2011-05-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	add-domain: Add allowuuid flag to allow UUIDs to be used for names.
	This makes a backwards-compatible change to the add-domain API.  If
	the optional allowuuid flag is true then UUIDs can be used instead of
	names in the domain name parameter.

2011-05-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	add-domain: Suppress libvirt errors on stderr.
	Install an error handler on the libvirt error connection so that
	errors are not printed on stderr (instead they go up through the usual
	libguestfs error mechanism).

	Unfortunately this doesn't suppress initial connection error messages
	to stderr.  I cannot see how to do this without affecting the global
	libvirt error handler, which is not acceptable for a library to be
	doing.

2011-05-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	doc: Use I<-...> for cross-references to command line options.
	This is now used consistently across all the documentation.

2011-05-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Refresh virt-df(1) man page.
	Add examples.

	Refresh description.

	Use I<...> to refer to command line options.

2011-04-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add a trace message to guestfs_close.
	Only the "first half" (ie. the call) is traced, because by the time
	the function returns the handle has gone and there's no way to
	generate events.

	You should see:

	  libguestfs: trace: close

	inspect: Look for %systemroot%/system32 for Windows heuristic.
	The virt-v2v transfer ISO had a /windows directory.  The core
	inspection code thought this was a Windows root filesystem.

	list-applications: If software hive is missing, this is an error.
	virt-inspector would exit silently if list-applications failed along

	Version 1.11.2.

2011-04-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	python: Release Python GIL while running libguestfs calls.
	Release the Python global interpreter lock while running libguestfs
	calls.

	We don't release it around guestfs_create() because that is a short
	call that just allocates memory.  We do release it around
	guestfs_close() since that is a potentially long-running (it can call
	wait(2) amongst other things).  We also release it around all the
	other generated Python calls.

	We don't yet support callbacks into Python code (ie. the new event
	API).  But when we do in future, we will need to also handle the GIL
	around those callbacks.

	This code is adapted from libvirt's python/typewrappers.h.  Thanks to
	Dan Berrange for showing us how to do this properly.

	inspector: Handle write failures when creating example-*.xml.

2011-04-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Delete file so db_load doesn't run incrementally.
	It turns out that db_load incrementally updates the database (instead
	of writing a new one).  Remove the old database to force db_load to
	write a new one.

	This also ensures that we handle write failure gracefully.

2011-04-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

2011-04-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Get version and release of RPM packages.
	This commit downloads the Packages RPM database allowing us to find
	other details about installed RPM packages (via
	inspect-list-applications).  This adds version and release.  Epoch
	cannot yet be found.

	This commit also updates the Fedora example image so that it contains
	a dummy RPM Packages database with some data.

2011-04-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Abstract out db_dump code for listing RPM applications.
	There are two changes here:

	(1) The code for listing RPM applications ran db_dump and parsed the
	output.  We abstract out that parsing code into a separate reusable
	module (src/dbdump.c).

	(2) The old db_dump parsing code used db_dump -p (printable) format.
	Instead use db_dump -k (hex) format so we can read binary fields.

2011-04-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Split code into separate files.
	The src/inspect.c file had grown rather large -- 3,500 lines.  Split
	it across several files according to function.

	This is just moving code.

	After the split the files are more evenly divided:

	  536 src/inspect_apps.c
	  766 src/inspect.c
	  537 src/inspect_fs.c
	  404 src/inspect_fs_cd.c

	This is just moving code around.

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Cache downloaded files in the handle g->tmpdir.
	During inspection we download various files such as the Windows
	'software' and 'system' registries.  Previously these were downloaded
	as temporary files and discarded immediately after use.  This meant
	that the 'software' registry was being downloaded twice by
	virt-inspector (it's required once for basic OS inspection, and a
	second time to list Windows applications).

	This commit changes this so that these files are cached in g->tmpdir,
	and thus the second time we just reuse the file we've already
	downloaded.

	Callers shouldn't be relying on inspect-list-applications to reread
	the actual registry from the VM (unless you close and reopen the
	handle).  It says in the documentation that the results of inspection
	may be cached in the handle.

2011-04-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove temporary directory containing arbitrary files.
	In preparation for caching inspection information in the temporary
	directory (g->tmpdir), allow the temporary directory to contain
	arbitrary files, and remove all of them when the handle is closed.

	This just generalizes the previous method of cleaning up the tmpdir.

2011-04-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Rewrite virt-resize in OCaml.
	This is a fairly straightforward translation of Perl virt-resize into
	OCaml.  It is bug-for-bug and feature-for-feature identical to the
	Perl version, except as noted below.

	The motivation is to have a more solid, high-level, statically safe
	compiled language to go forwards with fixing some of the harder bugs
	in virt-resize.  In particular contracts between different parts of
	the program are now handled by statically typed structures checked at
	compile time, instead of the very ad-hoc unchecked hash tables used by
	the Perl version.

	OCaml and the ocaml-pcre library (Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions
	bindings for OCaml) are required.

	Extra features in this version:

	- 32 bit hosts are now supported.

	- We try hard to handle the case where the target disk is not "clean"
	  (ie. all zeroes).  It usually works for this case, whereas the
	  previous version would usually fail.  However it is still
	  recommended that the system administrator creates a fresh blank disk
	  for the target before running the program.

	- User messages are a bit more verbose and helpful.  You can turn
	  these off with the -q (--quiet) option.

	There is one lost feature:

	- Ability to specify >= T (terabytes) sizes in command line size
	  expressions has been removed.  This probably didn't work in the Perl
	  version.

	Other differences:

	- The first partition on the target is no longer aligned; instead we
	  place it at the same sector as on the source.  I suspect that
	  aligning it was causing the bootloader failures.

	- Because it's easier, we do more sanity checking on the source disk.
	  This might lead to more failures, but they'd be failures you'd want
	  to know about.

	- The order in which operations are performed has been changed to make
	  it more logical.  The user should not notice any functional
	  difference, but debug messages will be quite a bit different.

	- virt-resize is a compiled binary, not a script.

	Compile rpcgen-generated files with -fno-strict-aliasing

2011-04-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	test-tool: Don't use static binary helper program, nor ISO.
	This simplifies the libguestfs-test-tool program down to essentials.
	Bugs most commonly occur when starting the appliance, so what we
	should concentrate on test is just that.

	Previously the test tool built a special static binary helper program,
	packaged it up in an ISO, then ran this inside the appliance.  None of
	this really tested useful failure modes, but they did make the test
	tool itself harder to build, harder for users to run, and more
	brittle.

	This change also adds some more debugging of libguestfs state.

2011-04-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update RELEASE-NOTES file.

2011-04-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

2011-04-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: inspect-get-drive-mappings
	This returns the drive mappings from the Windows Registry.

	virt-inspector displays the drive mappings, giving output
	similar to this:

	  <drive_mappings>
	    <drive_mapping name="C">/dev/sda2</drive_mapping>
	    <drive_mapping name="E">/dev/sdb1</drive_mapping>
	  </drive_mappings>

2011-04-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: inspect-get-windows-current-control-set
	This returns the actual registry key corresponding to
	CurrentControlSet (eg. it might be "ControlSet001").

	Previously the inspection code was hard-coding ControlSet001.  Now we
	use the correct control set, and also make it available to callers
	through the API.

	This commit also updates the virt-dhcp-address example so it uses this
	new API.

	virt-inspector displays the current control set when available.

2011-04-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Reimplement 'mounts' and 'mountpoints' commands.
	Reimplement these so they read /proc/mounts instead of trying to parse
	the output of the 'mount' external command.

	One consequence of this is that these commands now work again for
	ntfs-3g filesystems.

	Version 1.9.16.

	du: Add pulse mode progress messages.

	cpmv: Add pulse mode progress messages.

	checksum: Add pulse mode progress messages.

2011-04-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Introduce "pulse mode" progress events.
	This introduces a new form of progress event, where we don't know how
	much of the operation has taken place, but we nevertheless want to
	send back some indication of activity.  Some progress bar indicators
	directly support this, eg. GtkProgressBar where it is known as "pulse
	mode".

	A pulse mode progress message is a special backwards-compatible form
	of the ordinary progress message.  No change is required in callers,
	unless they want to add support for pulse mode.

	The daemon sends:

	 - zero or more progress messages with position = 0, total = 1
	 - a single final progress message with position = total = 1

	Note that the final progress message may not be sent if the call fails
	and returns an error.  This is consistent with the behaviour of
	ordinary progress messages.

	The daemon allows two types of implementation.  Either you can just
	call notify_progress (0, 1); ...; notify_progress (1, 1) as usual.

	Or you can call the functions pulse_mode_start, pulse_mode_end and/or
	pulse_mode_cancel (see documentation in daemon/daemon.h).  For this
	second form of call, the guarantee is very weak: it *just* says the
	daemon is still capable of doing something, and it doesn't imply that
	if there is a subprocess that it is doing anything.  However this does
	make it very easy to add pulse mode progress messages to all sorts of
	existing calls that depend on long-running external commands.

	To do: add a third variant that monitors a subprocess and only sends
	back progress messages if it's doing something, where "doing
	something" might indicate it's using CPU time or it's printing output.

2011-04-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: When running commands, restart select if we receive a signal.

	daemon: Reset SIGPIPE to default before running subprocesses.

2011-04-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generate progress messages during launch.
	This commit generates approximate progress messages during the
	guestfs_launch call.  Currently this code generates:

	   0 / 12: launch clock starts
	   3 / 12: appliance created
	   6 / 12: detected that guest kernel started
	   9 / 12: detected that /init script is running
	  12 / 12: launch completed successfully

	(Note this is not an ABI and may be changed or removed in a future
	version).

	Progress messages are only generated at all if 5 seconds have elapsed
	since the launch, and they are only generated for the ordinary
	appliance (not if using attach-method to attach to an existing virtio
	serial port).

2011-04-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	protocol: Sleep for 1ms before reading log messages.
	As explained in the comment:

	  /* QEMU's console emulates a 16550A serial port.  The real 16550A
	   * device has a small FIFO buffer (16 bytes) which means here we see
	   * lots of small reads of 1-16 bytes in length, usually single
	   * bytes.  Sleeping here for a very brief period groups reads
	   * together (so we usually get a few lines of output at once) and
	   * improves overall throughput, as well as making the event
	   * interface a bit more sane for callers.  With a virtio-serial
	   * based console (not yet implemented) we may be able to remove
	   * this.  XXX

	fuse: Fix getxattr, listxattr calls and add a regression test (RHBZ#691389).
	The documentation for the getxattr and listxattr calls is not very
	clear and as a result we were always returning something different
	from that which the Linux kernel would usually return.

	This fixes these calls, at least far enough that both the 'getfattr'
	and 'getfacl' programs now work fine on FUSE-mounted filesystems.

	Note that SELinux attrs are *not* passed through.  This appears to be
	a known bug between SELinux and FUSE.  For more information see:

	New API: guestfs_inspect_get_product_variant
	This returns a product variant for inspected operating systems.  In
	practice this is a useful way to distinguish between consumer and
	enterprise/server versions of Windows that otherwise have the same
	version number.

	fish: Add better quick help to --help output.

	fish: Add -w|--rw option to --help output.

	inspect: Don't fail for Windows guests with multiple disks (RHBZ#674130).

	inspect: Simplify Windows root heuristic code.
	Add special is_file_nocase and is_dir_nocase functions and
	remove the duplicate checks for files and directories with
	different cases.

	umount-all: Use /proc/mounts instead of output of 'mount' command.
	The particular issue is that ntfs-3g (or FUSE?) no longer appears
	to update /etc/mtab, which meant that umount-all was not unmounting
	these partitions.  But parsing /proc/mounts is simpler and more
	robust in any case.

	proto: Fix both-ends-cancel case.
	In the case where both ends cancel at the same time (eg. both ends
	realize there are errors before or during the transfer), previously we
	skipped sending back an error from the daemon, on the spurious basis
	that the library would not need it (the library is cancelling because
	of its own error).

	However this is wrong: we should always send back an error message
	from the daemon in order to preserve synchronization of the protocol.

	A simple test case is:

	  $ guestfish -N fs -m /dev/sda1 upload nosuchfile /
	  libguestfs: error: open: nosuchfile: No such file or directory
	  libguestfs: error: unexpected procedure number (66/282)

	(Notice two things: there are errors at both ends, and the
	loss of synchronization).

	After applying this commit, the loss of synchronization does not occur
	and we just see the library error:

	  $ guestfish -N fs -m /dev/sda1 upload nosuchfile /
	  libguestfs: error: open: nosuchfile: No such file or directory

	The choice of displaying the library or the daemon error is fairly
	arbitrary in this case -- it would be valid to display either or even
	to combine them into one error.  Displaying the library error only
	makes the code considerably simpler.

	This commit also (re-)enables a test for this case.

2011-03-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	proto: Fix FileIn ops that abort during the chunk upload stage.
	As a previous, incorrect attempt to fix RHBZ#576879 we tried to
	prevent the daemon from sending an error reply if the daemon had
	cancelled the transfer.  This is wrong: the daemon should send an
	error reply in these cases.

	A simple test case is this:

	  guestfish -N fs -m /dev/sda1 upload big-file /

	(This fails because the target "/" is a directory, not a file.)
	Prior to this commit, libguestfs would hang instead of printing an
	error.  With this commit, libguestfs prints an error.

	What is happening is:

	  (1) Library is uploading
	  a file                          (2) In the middle of the long
	                                  upload, daemon detects an error.
	                                  Daemon cancels.
	  (3) Library detects cancel,
	  sends cancel chunk, then waits
	  for the error reply from the
	  daemon.                         (4) Daemon is supposed to send
	                                  an error reply message.

	Because step (4) wasn't happening, uploads that failed like this would
	hang in the library (waiting for the error message, while the daemon
	was waiting for the next request).

	This also adds a regression test.

	This temporarily breaks the "both ends cancel" case (RHBZ#576879c5).
	Therefore the test for that is disabled, and this is fixed in the next
	patch in the series.

	This partially reverts commit dc706a639eec16084c0618baf7bfde00c6565f63.

2011-03-18  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	proto: Don't drop outgoing message when daemon cancels (RHBZ#576879).
	This is a (potential) fix for the long standing protocol bug
	which causes loss of synchronization when a FileIn action
	fails very early on the daemon side.  The canonical example
	would be the 'upload' action failing immediately if no filesystem
	is mounted.

	What's supposed to happen is this:

	  (1) library sends
	  request message              (2) daemon processes request
	  first chunk of data          and sees that it will fail,
	                               sends cancellation
	                               (3) discards chunks of data
	  (4) library sees daemon
	  cancellation and stops
	  sending chunks

	It was going wrong in step (1), in guestfs___send_to_daemon.
	In some (timing related) circumstances, send_to_daemon could
	receive the cancellation before sending the first chunk, at
	which point it would exit, *discarding the first chunk*.
	This causes the daemon to fail in step (3) since it reads the
	next request as if it was a chunk, thus losing synchronization.
	(The protocol specifies that you always have to send at least
	one chunk if there is a FileIn or FileOut parameter).

	The patch changes guestfs___send_to_daemon so that if it detects
	cancellation, it sends the remaining data in its output buffer
	instead of discarding it.  (This also fixes another edge case
	to do with sending partial data although I don't think we
	ever saw that in practice).

	daemon: Improve protocol debug messages.
	This adds 'guestfsd: ...' prefix before each message, and
	also puts a message at the top of the main loop just after
	a new message has been received.

	The intent is to make it simpler to follow the protocol.

2011-03-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	regressions: Enable both tests for bug 576879 (not fixed).

	daemon: Print error for invalid chunk.cancel field.
	The chunk.cancel field should always be [0|1].  If it is not then
	something has gone badly wrong -- probably loss of synchronization.
	If this occurs print a debug message and return error from
	receive_file function.

	proto: Improve debug messages.

	regressions: Split the test rhbz576879.sh into two halves.
	We suspect that there are in fact two separate bugs.  In any

2011-03-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New event API - Perl bindings (RHBZ#664558).
	The methods $h->set_progress_callback and $h->clear_progress_callback
	have been removed, and replaced with a complete mechanism for setting
	and deleting general-purpose events.

	This also updates virt-resize to use the new API.

2011-03-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New event API - OCaml bindings (RHBZ#664558).
	The functions set_progress_callback and clear_progress_callback have
	been removed, and replaced with a complete mechanism for setting and
	deleting general-purpose events.

2011-03-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New event API (RHBZ#664558).
	This API allows more than one callback to be registered for each
	event, makes it possible to call the API from other languages, and
	allows [nearly all] log, debug and trace messages to be rerouted from
	stderr.

	An older version of this API was discussed on the mailing list here:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010-December/msg00081.html
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2011-January/msg00012.html

	This also updates guestfish to use the new API for its progress bars.

2011-03-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: guestfs_first_private, guestfs_next_private to walk over the private data area.

	/etc/redhat-release on Red Hat Desktop contains the following
	string:
	  Red Hat Desktop release 4 (Nahant Update 8)

	Previously we matched against the string "Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
	but since this does not contain that string, this distro wasn't being
	detected correctly.

	Note this also changes the obsolete Perl code, for the benefit of
	virt-v2v.

	generator: Introduce error code (errcode) concept.
	There was a lot of repeated code to map return types (eg. RErr)
	to error cases (eg. -1 or NULL).

	This commit introduces an error code type and two functions to
	map return types to error codes and error codes to strings.

2011-03-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix trace segfault for non-daemon functions (RHBZ#682756).
	Previously we expanded the code for 'trace_return' unconditionally for
	all non-daemon functions.  However this code was not prepared to
	handle all error conditions, and in fact would segfault if it tried to
	print RStringList or RHashtable where r == NULL.

	We need to make the code conditional on the return value, calling
	either 'trace_return' or 'trace_return_error' as appropriate.

	Note the difficult case for RConstOptString which returns NULL in
	non-error cases.

	java: Fix generated functions that return RHashtable.
	Creating a HashMap directly from JNI is possible but very tedious
	(see: http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jni/html/fldmeth.html#26254)

	Instead we use the existing code to return hashes from JNI as plain
	String[], then add some code in the Java wrapper to convert these to
	HashMap<String,String>.

2011-03-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	java: Return Map<String,String> for RHashtable functions.

2011-03-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	java: Enable assertions when doing 'make check'.
	It turns out that Java assertions are disabled by default.  You have
	to add the 'java -ea' flag to the JVM.  Who knew ..?

	Because of this oversight, the tests weren't actually performing the
	assertions that we wanted (although in fact none of the assertions
	were failing).

	This change enables assertions when running the tests.

	daemon: Ignore return value from chdir.
	This updates commit 7eb012f3710bb554d5fc2c4229036901b0b5ad90.

	fish: Add guestfish --live, guestmount --live options.
	The other programs have the variable, but the flag is not enabled
	either because it doesn't make sense or because the implications are
	not well understood.

	Add documentation for attach method.

2011-02-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add guestfs_add_domain 'live' flag.
	This optional flag controls whether this API call will try to connect
	to a running virtual machine 'guestfsd' process.

	If the flag is given and the virtual machine is running, then the
	libvirt XML is parsed looking for a suitable <channel> element, and
	'guestfs_set_attach_method' is called with the corresponding
	virtio-serial socket path.

2011-02-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Implement attach-method unix:<path>
	Allow connections to a Unix domain socket which is connected
	(via virtio-serial) to a guestfsd running free in an existing
	guest.

	In order to use this you have to add the following element
	to the libvirt XML:

	  <channel type='unix'>
	    <source mode='bind' path='/tmp/socket'/>
	    <target type='virtio' name='org.libguestfs.channel.0'/>
	  </channel>

	(or perform the equivalent on the qemu command line).

	Then in guestfish, you can do:

	  guestfish \
	    attach-method unix:/tmp/socket : \
	    run : \
	    ll /

	(or any other commands as desired).

2011-02-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Allow -r option to run daemon standalone.
	This changes several aspects of the daemon.  Currently:

	* sysroot will be "" (ie. operate directly on /)
	* CHROOT_IN/CHROOT_OUT are disabled
	* autosync doesn't try to unmount everything

	Ensure the daemon always starts with current directory == root.

2011-02-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: set-attach-method, get-attach-method.
	These allow you to get and set the attach method.  The format
	is one of:

	* unix:<path>

	It's stored broken out into an enum and a string in the handle.

2011-02-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Move appliance launching to separate function.
	This is just code motion.

	php: Ignore another generated file in php/extension directory.

2011-02-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Parse /proc/mounts instead of /etc/mtab
	Since Fedora util-linux 2.19, the %post script does:

	  rm -f /etc/mtab
	  ln -s /proc/mounts /etc/mtab

	We are no longer running %post scripts, so this means that /etc/mtab
	is a plain file in the appliance.  Usual 'mount' still updates it, but
	for some reason mount.ntfs does *not* update it in Fedora 15, meaning
	that you couldn't mount and then operate on NTFS partitions.

	It seems better to always parse /proc/mounts (ie. what the kernel
	thinks is mounted) unconditionally, rather than relying on the
	capriciousness of the external mount command.

	Therefore, parse /proc/mounts instead of /etc/mtab, but add a note
	saying that in future we should really be parsing
	/proc/self/mountinfo, but that needs a custom parser, and the format
	is rather tricky:

	Add a new internal-autosync API to perform autosync.
	Instead of explicitly calling umount-all; sync, we add a daemon
	function called internal-autosync which does the same.

	Apart from slightly simplifying the process of closing the handle, the
	main advantage is we can modify the daemon for the standalone case so
	that internal-autosync does not do the umount-all operation.

2011-01-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add a prefix to output when tracing (RHBZ#673479).

	daemon: Replace root_mounted global with intelligence.
	We used to maintain a global flag 'root_mounted' which tells us if the
	user has mounted something on root (ie. on the sysroot directory).

	This flag caused a lot of trouble (eg. RHBZ#599503) because it's hard
	to keep the flag updated correctly when the user can do arbitrary
	mounts and also use mkmountpoint.

	Remove this flag and replace it with a test to see if something is
	mounted on *or under* the sysroot.  (It has to be *or under* because
	of mkmountpoint and friends).

	This also replaces a rather convoluted "have we mounted root yet"
	check in the mount* APIs with a simpler check to see if the mountpoint
	exists and is an ordinary directory.

	Use /var/tmp for the cached appliance (for FHS compliance).
	The FHS advises large files not to be stored in the root
	filesystem[1], and that /var/tmp is persistent across reboots[2]
	(whereas /tmp is possibly not[3]).

	Therefore we should store the large cached supermin appliance in
	/var/tmp instead of /tmp.  /tmp is still used for all other temporary
	files and directories.

	In either case you can override this by setting $TMPDIR.

	fish: Factor out command line parsing.
	Factor out the code which splits a string into a command line.

	fish: Make exit_on_error into a completely local variable.
	Note that 'time' and 'glob' (which both run subcommands) do not
	correctly pass the exit_on_error flag in the remote case.  This is not
	a regression: the current code doesn't work either.

	fish: exit_on_error is a local variable.

	todo: Live CD inspection works, but not for Windows 7.

	Version 1.9.4.

	README: Note that po4a is mandatory if compiling from git.

	Add ability to inspect install disks and live CDs.
	For examples of the virt-inspector output, see the additional
	inspector/example-*.xml files in this commit.

	inspect: Add macros for file size limits.
	This also bumps the file size limit for "small text files"
	up to 2 MB, since we want to parse Windows CD txtsetup.sif
	files that are usually around 500K in size.

2011-01-14  Nikita A Menkovich  <menkovich@gmail.com>

	New API: resize2fs-M to resize ext2/3/4 to minimum size.

	Version 1.9.3.

2011-01-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Skip final '/' character when calculating basename.
	Previously it was including the final '/' character when calculating
	the basename for the -a option eg:

	Filesystem                                Size       Used  Available  Use%
	/Ubuntu1010x64:/dev/sda1                  9.4G       2.3G       6.6G   25%

	With this patch the '/' is not printed.

2011-01-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Don't fail if some mountpoints in /etc/fstab are bogus (RHBZ#668574).
	Fix guestfish (and other C tools) so that they ignore errors
	when /etc/fstab contains bogus entries.

	Update the documentation for inspect-get-mountpoints to emphasize
	that callers must be aware of this when mounting the returned
	values.

	Add a regression test.

	Update the example code ("inspect_vm") to reflect the way this
	API ought to be called.

	todo: Add notes on inspecting ISO images.

2011-01-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-filesystems: Ignore errors when getting label and UUID (RHBZ#668112).
	If virt-filesystems was pointed to an image that contained
	bogus or blank filesystems, then calls to vfs-label and/or vfs-uuid
	could fail, resulting in errors like this:

	libguestfs: error: vfs_label: /dev/vda1:

	These errors can be ignored and shouldn't stop virt-filesystems
	from working.

2011-01-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	This also adds a regression test.

2011-01-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Fix off-by-one bug in tilde expansion.
	Although this doesn't seem to cause a crash, valgrind confirms
	that this is a genuine off-by-one bug.  It could potentially
	cause a crash if you did:

	  echo 'echo ~root/foo' | guestfish

2011-01-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.9.2.

	New tools: virt-copy-in, virt-copy-out, virt-tar-in, virt-tar-out.
	Relatively trivial wrappers around the equivalent guestfish
	commands.  Change also includes new man pages.

	.gitignore: Use full paths for some ignored files.

	Version 1.7.24.

	ntfs-3g: Document problems with symlinks and alternatives (RHBZ#663407).

2010-12-16  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: getxattr and lgetxattr to get single extended attributes.
	These APIs are essentially required to work around a problem
	with ntfs-3g.  This filesystem (or FUSE?) does not list all
	extended attributes of a file when you call listxattr(2).  However
	if you know the name of an extended attribute, you can retrieve
	it directly using getxattr(2).

	The current APIs (getxattrs etc) are simple to use, but they
	don't work if we can't list out the extended attributes (ie.
	by calling listxattr(2)).

	Example using the new APIs on an ntfs-3g filesystem:

	><fs> lgetxattr "/Documents and Settings" system.ntfs_attrib | hexdump -C

2010-12-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Don't set utime on cachedir until we know it is safe.
	This could be used to touch an arbitrary file (albeit one which
	must already exist), and this could have been a security problem.

	appliance: Touch cached appliance files so they don't get tmp cleaned.

	Remove extra \n character from end of error messages.

	Version 1.7.22.

2010-12-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Be careful about cleaning up old appliances.
	This change resolves several issues with current appliance
	building:

	(1) Old appliances are cleaned up.

	(2) Race conditions between appliance building is handled better.

	(3) Several bugs fixed.

2010-12-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Use prog_exists to check for features.
	This updates commit 0938509e0422363554023ab99381fd70a22a6e08.

	debian: Work around warning in Debian udev init script.
	See also:
	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=606622

	win-reg: Add Windows Tips to documentation.

	win-reg: Move documentation after options, combine shell quote sections.

	(Revealed by compiling under Debian where this is a warning).

2010-12-10  Thomas S Hatch  <thatch45@gmail.com>

	Added packages for Archlinux support

2010-12-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	debian: Dependencies for all the different names of qemu/KVM.

	debian: Quilt is not used for patch management.

	cat: Remove some unused local variables in virt-cat.c and virt-ls.c.

2010-12-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add debian/ directory (temporarily).
	This was created initially from pkg-libvirt/libguestfs.git
	commit 680ff0b0e8c9133ef987e68392bd3990715f6891.

	This is a temporary measure to allow us to build Debian and Ubuntu
	packages more easily.  When downstream packaging is being done on
	these distros we will remove this directory again.

	To build a Debian package, use this command:

	  debuild -i -us -uc -b

2010-12-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	debian: Exclude file-rc.
	This package duplicates /etc/init.d/README which is
	really supplied by sysv-rc package.

	build: Use ./configure --with-python-installdir=DIR to select Python dir.
	We don't always want to install in the site-packages directory.  Allow
	the directory to be chosen using a configure option.  Rename the
	variable PYTHON_INSTALLDIR to reflect its true purpose.

	build: Add "checking ... result" around Python tests.

	build: Remove check for root.
	With the new package building system, it is no longer dangerous to run
	'configure', 'make' or 'make check' as root (although it is still not
	necessary and not advisable).  In any case we don't need to check
	this.

	inspector: Remove some unused local variables.

	fish: Remove some unused local variables.

	build: Remove AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION macro.
	See discussion on the mailing list:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010-December/thread.html#00032

2010-12-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	rescue: Add notes about networking.
	In particular the 'ping' command does not work because it is
	using QEMU user networking.

	rescue: Add note about using virt-rescue as root/non-root.

2010-12-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Link to guestfs-examples(3) after simple example.

	docs: Note that guestfs_sync is no longer necessary.

	Version 1.7.20.

	build: relink-static.sh script removed from EXTRA_DIST.
	This updates commit 9bc15f5d98a3a17d465a94f42dc3ffb60c077293.

2010-12-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ubuntu: deactivate LVs and VGs before removing them.
	Even with the '-f' option, LVM on Ubuntu sometimes cannot remove
	active LVs and VGs.

	Change lvm-remove-all so it deactivates each LV and VG before
	removing them.

2010-12-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Revert "umount-all: Add udev_settle after unmounting disks."
	This reverts commit ad2abf89c364d5ec73fb12af63b053637d99d757.

	Ubuntu still has errors even with the addition of udev_settle
	after umount-all.  Therefore this was just masking the problem.

2010-12-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	debian: Fix ntfs3g available API on Debian.
	Really we should have a test for "is program on $PATH?" but this
	fix will do for now.

	fuse: Set UID and GID when performing FUSE tests.
	This avoids breakage on Ubuntu.

	autobuild: Skip some tests on Ubuntu.

	ubuntu: Allow test-luks.sh to be bypassed to workaround Ubuntu bug.
	This is necessary because of too old cryptsetup on Ubuntu.

	umount-all: Add udev_settle after unmounting disks.
	This helps avoid an error on Ubuntu, but it's not clear if this
	is a real solution or just helps by adjusting the timing of some
	race condition.

	fuse: Disable test which doesn't run reliably on Debian.
	See discussion in RHBZ#660687.

	fuse: Fix emulation of open call.
	We were being over-complex in this call.  All the FUSE API requires
	this call to do is to check permissions.

	fuse: Fix segfault in guestmount --verbose.
	If hash_delete returns NULL and --verbose option was given then
	this would cause a segfault.

	Add autobuild script.

	gitignore: Ignore all local* files in the main directory.

2010-12-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Don't quote the --exclude parameters.
	The quotes appear literally on the command line:

	$ s="--foo 'bar'"
	$ echo $s
	--foo 'bar'

2010-12-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add --with-febootstrap-yum-config.
	This allows the febootstrap --yum-config option to be passed through,
	allowing a separate yum configuration to be used.

	The hope is that this will enable building in Koji.

2010-12-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove ability to build static distribution.
	We are now going to build binaries for each distribution so
	there is no need to build the quasi-distro-independent static
	binaries any more.

	regressions: Disable test for 576879.
	This test has worked only intermittently for a while.  Disable
	it.  The upstream bug has been reopened.

	build: Use grub-pc instead of old grub on Debian and Ubuntu.

	build: Add diff to package list for Debian and Ubuntu.

	build: Add cpio package to package list (for Debian and Ubuntu).

	build: Look for other db_dump variations (for Ubuntu).

	ubuntu: Disable xfsprogs from Ubuntu package list.

	ubuntu: Make Ubuntu into a separate distro for the package list.
	This allows us to select Ubuntu packages separately from Debian ones.

	build: Don't emit warnings about stack protector failures.
	These are seen on gcc 4.5.1 used in Ubuntu.

	debian: Enable more packages in packagelist.in.
	These were previously disabled because of problems with
	debirf.  Now we are not using debirf, we can use them
	again.

2010-12-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.19.

	Debian: Extra packages needed to run C API tests.

2010-12-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Change to using febootstrap 3.x supermin appliance.
	This removes all support for building the ordinary / old
	style appliance using febootstrap 2.x, debootstrap, debirf,
	fakeroot and fakechroot.

	Instead this uses febootstrap 3.x to build the supermin appliance
	in a simpler cross-distro manner.

2010-12-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Put /init in a separate supermin appliance component.

	appliance: Don't look for kmod.whitelist.
	This file is not used for building the supermin appliance.

2010-12-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: mkfs_opts, mkfs with optional arguments.
	This is an extensible version of 'mkfs' which supports optional
	arguments.  There is now no need for 'mkfs_b' since you should
	use 'mkfs_opts' with the optional 'blocksize' argument instead.

2010-12-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Code to handle optional arguments in daemon functions.
	Previously we only supported optional arguments for library
	functions (commit 14490c3e1aac61c6ac90f28828896683f64f0dc9).

	This extends that work so that optional arguments can also be
	passed through to the daemon.

2010-12-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Fix generation of code to handle Int/Int64 optional arguments.

	Fix argv struct mixup over Int/Int64.

	todo: Refresh documentation.

2010-12-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.18.

	Add progress notification messages to upload and upload-offset APIs.

	protocol: Handle progress notification messages during FileIn.
	If the daemon sends progress notification messages while we
	are uploading FileIn parameters, these are received in
	check_for_daemon_cancellation_or_eof.  Modify this library
	function so that it turns these messages into callbacks.

2010-12-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	protocol: Really read 4 bytes while checking for cancellation.
	We've not actually hit this bug in practice, but at least in
	theory while checking for cancellation we could read > 0 but
	fewer than 4 bytes, which would effectively be discarded and
	we would lose synchronization.

	Note the socket is non-blocking.

	Change the code so that we temporarily set the socket back to
	blocking and force the read of all 4 bytes.

2010-12-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	protocol: Send progress_hint in header.
	For actions that have FileIn arguments, count the size of all
	the input files and send that in the progress_hint field of the
	request header.

2010-12-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	protocol: Upload progress messages and optional arguments.
	Two unrelated changes to the protocol to support progress
	messages during uploads, and optional arguments.

	Note that this makes an incompatible change to the protocol,
	and this is reflected in the protocol version field (3 -> 4).

2010-11-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Fix segfault when using virt-df -a filename
	If 'filename' doesn't contain a '/' character then virt-df
	was calculating NULL as the basename and later segfaulting.

	Version 1.7.17.

	php: Combine tests to reduce number of launches.

	haskell: Combine tests to reduce number of launches.

	java: Combine tests to reduce number of launches.

	python: Combine tests to reduce number of launches.

	ocaml: Combine tests together to reduce number of launches.
	Combine launch, lvcreate and readdir tests together into a
	single 'basic' test, so that we don't launch the appliance
	so often when testing in this subdirectory.

2010-11-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	capitests: Convert many InitBasicFS tests to InitScratchFS.
	These tests run much more quickly if you don't have to run
	'mkfs' and (particularly) partitioning/LV commands between each
	test.

	The total time for running 'make -C capitests check' on my laptop
	has gone from 413 seconds down to 221 seconds.

2010-11-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	capitests: Add 'InitScratchFS' test environment.
	This should allow us to perform filesystem-based write
	tests much more quickly, because we don't need to recreate
	the filesystem from scratch each time.

	capitests: Move test documentation into HACKING file.

2010-11-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	capitests: Use /dev/sdc for misc tests (instead of /dev/sdb).
	This change means that /dev/sdb is not being used during
	the tests (except passively, eg. in listings of devices).

	This allows us (in a forthcoming commit) to use /dev/sdb as a
	quick scratch filesystem for testing writes.

2010-11-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Fix small inaccuracies in virt-resize(1).

	docs: Fix typo in virt-filesystems(1).

	docs: Remove ref to L</add-drive-opts> wrongly copied into some man pages.

2010-11-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update API support.

	Updated RELEASE-NOTES file.

	Version 1.7.16.

	fish: Don't use external pod2text program.
	This removes the dependency from guestfish to the external
	pod2text program (and hence the final dependency on perl for
	guestfish).  This is done by storing the formatted pod2text
	output in guestfish as the help text.

2010-11-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: More options for internal pod2text generator.
	Allow extra width, and trimming options.

	This necessitates a change in the memoized format.  To avoid
	causing crashes if a new generator loads the old format, also
	change the filename of the memo file.

2010-11-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	libtool fix: Don't do fix if there was no -o option to libtool.
	For example if libtool is being run as 'libtool --mode=execute ...'

	This fixes commit 4cf4f2b66f850bb39c5bf29d3cd12ada9114d67e.

2010-11-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.15.

	build: Add several missing shell scripts to dist.

2010-11-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove dependency_libs from libtool *.la files.
	Add a libtool wrapper which kills dependency_libs in libtool *.la
	files, to ensure that libtool doesn't add unnecessary extra libraries
	when linking.

	See http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2010-November/146343.html

2010-11-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Missing direct dependency on libvirt.
	virt-df has an (optional) direct dependency on libvirt.  Because of
	libtool's over-linking behaviour this was being missed.

	rescue: Rewrite virt-rescue in C.

	Update HACKING description of tools/ subdirectory.
	This fixes commit 18374b5b7d3154e0b8b8a07e3590f6eee762b58e.

	daemon: Close leaked file descriptor along checksum error path (RHBZ#657499).

2010-11-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.14.

2010-11-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Rewrite virt-df in C.
	I have diffed the output from the original virt-df with this
	new version, and they agree very closely.  Some differences:

	 - Old virt-df have a divide-by-zero error in cases where the
	   number of used inodes was 0.  New virt-df fixes this.

	 - New virt-df uses gnulib human_readable library which displays
	   numbers to 3 significant figures for -h output (old version
	   used an ad hoc function).

2010-11-25  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Export private function 'guestfs___for_each_disk' for use by virt-df.
	This private function (not part of the API) allows us to
	iterate over disks from a guest, avoiding the business of
	writing all the XPath code yet again.

	fish: Keep device names in options drives list.
	In the 'struct drv *drvs' structure, keep a list of the
	device name(s) for each added drive or guest.  The device name
	is the canonical name as that drive would be known inside
	libguestfs, eg. "/dev/sda"

	Fix memory leak (xptype XPath obj) in add-domain API.

2010-11-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.13.

	regressions: Fix test-launch-race to work in non-supermin case.

	daemon: blkid cache is at a different location on Debian.
	Remove both possible cache locations.

	debian: Include ntfsprogs in the appliance.
	This allows us to build NTFS filesystems at least.  Mounting
	NTFS doesn't work in Debian because of a problem with debirf.

2010-11-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Detect if db_dump and db_load programs are available.
	If db_dump is not available then disable RPM application detection.

	Note these utilities have odd names on Debian.

2010-11-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

2010-11-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.10.

	generator: trace mode prints return values.

	generator: Make return value into an explicit variable.
	This is just code motion.

	generator: Make trace flag an explicit variable.
	This is just code motion.

	todo: Suggest that trace should include return values.

2010-11-16  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	rescue: Fix typo in documentation of --network option.

	Version 1.7.9.

	inspector: Replace old examples with ones derived from phony images.

	images: Make phony Windows image for testing.

	images: Make phony Ubuntu image for testing.

	images: Make a phony Debian image for testing.

	images: Make a better phony Fedora image.
	This now includes a product string, major and minor version,
	hostname and even some applications.

	daemon: findfs-uuid and findfs-label should not return /dev/mapper paths.

	New API: inspect-get-hostname to return the hostname of the guest.
	This returns the hostname of the guest.  Tested on RHEL, Fedora,
	Debian 5, Ubuntu 10.10, FreeBSD 8, Windows 7.

	inspect: Check /etc/lsb-release is not too large before calling head on it.

	inspect: Add function to read the first line of a file, with safety checks.

	inspect: Abstract the wrapper that sets up Augeas.
	This is just code motion.

2010-11-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.8.

	inspector: Replace code for listing applications with new core API.

2010-11-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: inspect-list-applications.
	This converts the current Perl code in virt-inspector for
	listing applications, into C, making it a part of the core API.

	This is also capable of fetching the list of Windows applications
	from the registry.

2010-11-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Centralize all file downloads through a single function.

2010-11-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Add support for Linux Mint and Mandriva.
	Linux Mint is derived from Ubuntu.

	Mandriva has a release file, but it also has /etc/lsb-release and
	the same parsing code can be reused.  Mandriva has a package manager
	called urpmi.

2010-11-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Put list of distros in alphabetical order.

	docs: Debian and Ubuntu are now separate distros.

	build: Missing backslash again.

2010-11-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.6.

	filearch: Refuse to download initrd if it is huge.

	inspect: Fix error out path if minor_version parsing fails.

	inspect: Refuse to download software hive if it is huge.

	inspect: Refuse to parse /etc/fstab if it is huge.

	lib: Make some error strings localizable.

2010-11-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Inspection support for FreeBSD.
	This adds inspection support for FreeBSD.

	However this is not quite enough to allow guestfish -i freebsd.img
	to work, because guestfish will try to mount the filesystems,
	which cannot be done because Linux requires special mount options
	for the Universal Filesystem (UFS) used by *BSD.  Nevertheless
	you can manually run the same commands.

2010-11-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: Optimize root filesystem check.
	Avoid duplicate checks for things like /etc and /bin.

	lib: Add match3 function.

	lib: Add safe_asprintf function.

	docs: Add a section on security.

2010-11-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Rearrange guestfs(3) sections.
	This rearranges the sections into a more logical order:

	 - synopsis and introduction
	 - API-related overview sections
	 - (security will go here, see next commit)
	 - API in detail
	 - architecture and other internals
	 - usual end sections

2010-11-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	static: Use correct libraries for static binaries.
	Also add virt-cat.static target.

	Version 1.7.5.

2010-11-12  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ruby: Add 'make install' rule for ruby bindings (RHBZ#652796).

	todo: Notes on parsing.

2010-11-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: inspect-get-package-format, inspect-get-package-management.
	This APIs reimplement some parts of virt-inspector in C.

2010-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	capitests: Remove warning about dead definitions.
	This updates commit cb7ec8be4ce6068b6cbc6522a67826cdbd161024.

	Check that just including <guestfs.h> on its own works.

2010-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Don't need to include XDR headers in <guestfs.h>.
	Include the XDR headers in the internal guestfs-internal.h instead.

	This is knock-on effects to several other source files which
	were implicitly relying on indirectly loaded headers.

2010-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Be less verbose in the macros defending typedefs in <guestfs.h>.
	This updates commit 4d59e271046f2b5f0d9b1730cd23425fd631c76c.

	perl: Ignore debug functions in Test::Pod::Coverage.

	Version 1.7.4.

	build: xml-light is no longer required (thanks Maxim Koltsov).
	At some point we removed the last thing that required
	xml-light, but were still testing for it at various places
	in the build.  This removes all traces.

2010-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Rewrite virt-cat in C.
	With changes in the core API since 1.5, virt-cat was little
	more than a Perl wrapper which did some command line argument
	processing.  Thus it could easily be rewritten in C.

	This version also shares core command line argument processing
	with guestfish and guestmount, so the options have changed
	slightly (old-style command line *is* supported).

	 virt-cat -a disk.img file [file ...]
	 virt-cat -d domname file [file ...]

	Several other guestfish options are supported including encryption,
	and with the new style multiple files can be downloaded.  See the
	man page for details.

2010-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generate a dummy 'Fedora' fedora.img in images directory for use by tests.
	We were generating this dummy 'Fedora' image already in the
	tools directory.  It contains just enough Fedora-like files
	to fool our inspection code and thus to test the tools.

	This is general enough that we can use it everywhere.

2010-11-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Defend all typedefs in <guestfs.h> with #ifdefs.
	This allows other libraries to redefine those typedefs
	if they need to use but not depend on <guestfs.h>.

	lib: Make <guestfs.h> be completely generated.
	This removes the 'not-quite-separate' guestfs-actions.h and
	guestfs-structs.h files.

	Fix small typo in a comment in src/Makefile.am.

	capitests: Add the code to test (proposed) add-libvirt-dom C API.
	This API was dropped as there are some problems with it.  This
	commit adds the original test code, but commented out.

2010-11-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Use core add-domain API to implement '-d' option.
	This also makes libxml2 and libvirt into optional dependencies.
	If they are missing then the core API will print an error, as
	will the '-d' option to guestfish.

2010-11-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: add-domain
	This new API allows you to add the disks from a libvirt
	domain.

	In guestfish you can use the 'domain' command to access the
	API, eg:

	><fs> domain Fedora14 libvirturi:qemu:///system
	1

	The returned number is the number of disks that were added.

	Also here is a proposed (but commented out) low-level API
	which would allow you to add a domain from a virDomainPtr.
	However there are several problems with this API -- see discussion
	on the list:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010-November/thread.html#00028

2010-11-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Add Pointer parameter type to the generator.
	This allows generic "foo *bar" pointers to be passed to
	library functions (not to daemon functions).

	In the language bindings (except Perl) these are handled
	as generic int64s with the assumption being that any
	pointer can be converted to and from this.  There is room
	to add specific support for some pointer types in future
	by specializing the match cases.  However this is inherently
	tricky because it depends on the implementation details of
	other bindings (eg. to support virDomainPtr in OCaml depends
	on the implementation details of the ocaml-libvirt project).

	Perl is slightly different in that you have to supply a
	typemap.  Again this would depend on the implementation
	detail of an external library unless you supplied a generic
	typemap for int64.

2010-11-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: debug-cmdline for printing QEMU command line (internal only).
	This is an internal-only debugging API so may be changed or
	removed at any time in the future.

2010-11-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add internal facility to checkpoint and roll back the command line.
	This internal interface can be used to ensure that certain
	operations are atomic.

2010-11-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	lib: Make pcre, libmagic and hivex libraries optional.
	This change makes these libraries optional.  If they are not
	available at compile time then certain core API features will
	be disabled (see below).

	This also changes PCRE detection to use pkg-config instead
	of the ad hoc autoconf checks.

	The large inspect.c file has been split out into separate
	function-specific files.

	  file-architecture: requires pcre & libmagic
	  inspection: requires pcre & hivex

2010-11-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Don't include debug* commands in the documentation.

	capitests: Add whitespace in Makefile.

2010-11-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspect: win64 regexp was dead code.

	lib: Augeas (client side) is not needed by the library.
	However it is used by the daemon.

2010-11-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ocaml: Error on compiler warnings.

	ruby: Remove extra space before parenthesis.

2010-11-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Revert "autogen: Touch ocaml/.depend"
	This reverts commit a0f85ba643990da25b6afe6a2bbd2407cf312c73.

2010-11-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Revert "Remove ocaml/.depend from git."
	This reverts commit 064569bcbf854a9cf588ce31851d987d5f114ec8.

	This commit does the wrong thing: creating an empty ocaml/.depend
	file is wrong because building the OCaml bindings will fail.
	Not having this file will prevent automake from running.  Therefore
	this file has to exist with the correct content in git.

2010-11-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.7.3.

	build: Create an AUTHORS file.

2010-11-08  Maxim Koltsov  <kolmax94@gmail.com>

	build: Don't try to rebuild po-docs/<lang> if no po4a.

	build: Add ./configure --disable-php option.
	This disables the PHP language bindings.

2010-11-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	build: Test for virt tools Perl libraries conditionally.
	Only test for these if $PERL is defined, and use $PERL as
	the interpreter.

2010-11-08  Maxim Koltsov  <kolmax94@gmail.com>

	build: Add ./configure --disable-haskell option.
	This disables the Haskell language bindings.

	build: Add ./configure --disable-ruby option.
	This disables the Ruby language bindings.

	build: Warn if Python include or site-packages not found.

	build: Add ./configure --disable-python option.
	This disables the Python language bindings.

	build: Add ./configure --disable-perl option.
	This disables the Perl bindings.

2010-11-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ocaml: Remove the old OCaml viewer program.
	This program is obsolete and the code has been reused for
	guestfs-browser here:
	http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/guestfs-browser/

2010-11-08  Maxim Koltsov  <kolmax94@gmail.com>

	build: Add ./configure --disable-ocaml option.
	This can be used to disable the OCaml bindings.  Note that
	OCaml is still required in any case where you need to rerun
	the generator.

	build: Add ./configure --disable-fuse option.
	If this option is specified, FUSE support is unconditionally
	disabled.

2010-11-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	supermin: If disabled, don't compile in supermin code or check for supermin.
	If supermin is disabled at compile time and the user just wants to
	use the ordinary appliance, there is no need to compile in all
	the supermin code, and in particular there is no need to check
	for the supermin appliance (which involves running
	febootstrap-supermin-helper that probably doesn't exist).

	This fixes a warning message observed under Debian w/o supermin:

	  sh: febootstrap-supermin-helper: command not found

2010-11-08  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Add --rw option (does nothing yet).
	This adds the guestfish --rw option, intended in future
	to be required for writing to disk images.

	At the moment this does not change the default and so does
	nothing.  This patch is intended for backporting to the
	stable branches so that we can start to introduce scripts
	which use 'guestfish --rw'.

2010-11-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add missing generated files to the tarball (thanks maksbotan).
	C# bindings were omitted entirely.  Add a Makefile.am for this
	directory even though we don't build these.

	Because of a missing backslash, some POD files were not being
	included.

2010-11-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Add --listen --csh to for csh, tcsh compatibility.
	(Thanks Eric Blake).

2010-11-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Suggest safer form of eval.
	eval "$(guestfish --listen)"

	instead of various other forms.

	(Thanks Eric Blake).

2010-11-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: More portable export sh statment.
	Don't depend on bash, but allow sh/dash/etc format:
	GUESTFISH_PID=nn; export GUESTFISH_PID

	(Thanks Eric Blake).

2010-11-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: inspect-get-roots to return roots from last inspection.
	Return the roots found by the last call to inspect-os, but
	without redoing the whole inspection.

	generator: Don't die if an API call isn't listed in API versions file.
	For example, it may just have been added.

	Version 1.7.2.

2010-11-05  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	configure: Test for 'kvm' binary.

	Include <stdarg.h> in public header.
	Public headers use va_list, and this gives an error unless <stdarg.h>
	had been included before the header.

2010-11-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Don't print out key material in trace output.

2010-11-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: '-i' option automatically handles whole-disk encryption.
	This feature is also available in guestmount because of the
	shared option parsing code.

	You don't need to do anything to enable it, just using -i
	will attempt decryption of encrypted partitions.

	Only works for simple Fedora whole-disk encryption.  It's a
	work-in-progress to make it work for other types of encryption.

2010-11-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	docs: Fix API support script.
	Before libguestfs 1.0.69 we needed to look in src/guestfs.c to

	Ensure atomic creation of a cached appliance
	Cached appliances are discovered by their predictable path. Previously we were
	creating a cached appliance directly in this predictable path. This had at least
	2 undesirable effects:

	* Interrupting appliance creation would leave a corrupt appliance
	* 2 processes could simultaneously attempt to create the same appliance, causing
	  corruption.

	This patch causes the cached appliance to be created in a temporary directory,
	and then renamed to the predictable path. As rename is an atomic operation, this
	makes the whole creation atomic.

	This patch also changes the predictable path to have a prefix of 'guestfs.'.
	This will make it simpler for system administrators to clean up old cached
	appliances.

	This patch resolves RHBZ#639405

2010-10-28  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Call febootstrap-supermin-helper using the new -u and -g options
	Use febootstrap-supermin-helper's new -u and -g command line options to setuid,
	rather than doing it in libguestfs.

	This resolves an issue with the generation of the cached appliance checksum. The
	checksum was being generated by a call to febootstrap-supermin-helper through
	popen(). Unfortunately, a bash misfeature meant that euid would be reset to uid,
	and the checksum was generated for uid, not euid. When virt-v2v is writing to a
	RHEV target, uid == 0 and euid == 36, which resulted in a cached appliance being
	created for root with permissions for uid 36.

	Note this requires febootstrap 2.10.

2010-10-28  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Log the febootstrap-supermin-helper command line
	A side-effect of change 17e7cb9937a63ed8f9bb0fb6ac7302758be76846 was the the
	febootstrap-supermin-helper was no longer logged. This change adds it back using
	the new guestfs___print_timestamped_argv internal function.

	New internal function guestfs___print_timestamped_argv
	This function generalises the existing print_cmdline used to output the qemu
	command line to output any given command line, and exports it to other modules.
	It also adds a timestamp to the old print_cmdline output for consistency with
	guestfs___print_timestamped_message.

	list-filesystems: Use core list-filesystems API (RHBZ#642933).
	Change virt-list-filesystems to use the core inspection API
	instead of the deprecated Sys::Guestfs::Lib::get_partitions
	function.

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib: deprecate get_partitions (RHBZ#642933).
	However the code is left since this function is used
	by virt-v2v amongst others.

2010-10-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspector: Rewrite virt-inspector (RHBZ#642930).
	Rewrite virt-inspector:

	 - remove old and unsupportable features
	 - use the C inspection API
	 - don't run programs from the guest

	The RNG has been updated to reflect the new XML-only output.

	The new example files show the new XML output.

2010-10-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tools: Use C API for inspection (RHBZ#642930).
	Update the following tools to use the C API for inspection:

	 - virt-cat

	 - virt-ls
	 - virt-tar
	 - virt-win-reg

	None of the tools in the tools/ directory now use the deprecated
	Perl inspection APIs.

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib: deprecate inspection functions (RHBZ#642930).

2010-10-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Unify guestfish and guestmount options processing (RHBZ#642932).
	In guestfish, factor out the processing of the options -a, -c,
	-d, -i, -m, -n, -r, -v, -V, -x into a separate set of files:
	options.c, options.h, inspect.c, virt.c.

	Change guestmount so that it uses these same files (from the
	../fish directory) to process the same options.

	This unifies the handling of these options between the two programs.
	It also adds the useful inspection feature to guestmount, so you
	can now do:

	  guestmount -d Guest -i --ro mnt/

2010-10-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Add --uuid option to print guest UUIDs instead of names (RHBZ#646821).

	todo: Remove obsolete items from TODO file.

	Document problems mixing mkmountpoint and umount-all (RHBZ#599503).

	appliance: Repo name is not Fedora-specific.
	The --with-repo parameter is also used by Debian to specify
	the Debian software repository, so remove references to
	Fedora.

	appliance: Remove repo from appliance filename (RHBZ#638901).
	There's no need to have the appliance filename contain the
	repository name it was built from, and this change gives
	downstream users more freedom to mix and match libraries
	and appliances if they want to.

	inspection: Ignore floppy disks and CD-ROM drives (RHBZ#642929).

	Enable autosync by default.

2010-10-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	/dev/mapper paths should not be returned from C inspection APIs (RHBZ#638899).
	With this patch, /dev/mapper paths do not appear in the output
	of guestfs_inspect_os, as you can see from this example:

	Welcome to guestfish, the libguestfs filesystem interactive shell for
	editing virtual machine filesystems.

	Type: 'help' for a list of commands
	      'man' to read the manual
	      'quit' to quit the shell

	/dev/vda1 mounted on /boot

2010-10-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: lvm-canonical-lv-name: make LV name canonical.
	When logical volume names appear in places like /etc/fstab
	files they can have the form "/dev/mapper/foo-bar".  This
	function takes such names and makes them canonical.

	Note that this operation cannot be performed using the current
	API, because 'guestfs_stat' does not work on device names, and
	we don't really want to make a 'stat-device' call since that
	exposes too much non-useful detail about the appliance.

	With this patch you can do this:

	Don't use kernel module whitelist with ext2-based appliance.
	Since the ext2-based appliance is cached, and since it is not
	all loaded into memory (as with the initrd), we might as well
	put all the kernel modules in there.

	Note the kmod.whitelist.in file is still used for building the
	ordinary appliance.

	Fix networking in the appliance.
	Commit 4963be85 re-introduced networking to the appliance,
	but didn't configure the custom network the appliance expects
	since we switched to link local addressing. This patch
	configures QEMU to use the custom network again.

	Note that you still need to use guestfs_set_network (g, 1)
	to enable user networking.

	resize: Specify format of input, output disk (RHBZ#642934,CVE-2010-3851).
	This adds two new options: --format specifies the format of the
	input disk, and --output-format specified the format of the output
	disk.

	Requiring the format of the output disk seems a bit strange at first:
	after all, this is the disk that the virt-resize user has to create.
	However it is needed because we sometimes reopen this disk, after
	copying data over the first sector, and in theory a raw-format guest
	could write a qcow2 header here and have it copied to the output
	disk, which we would subsequently reopen.

	The format parameter is taken from libvirt if available, else
	the user should supply the '--format' parameter (eg. for local
	disk files).

2010-10-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tools: Specify format of disks (RHBZ#642934,CVE-2010-3851).
	Sys::Guestfs::Lib is changed in two ways: firstly we take the format
	string from libvirt and pass it to add_drive_opts.  Secondly we allow
	an extra format =>  parameter to open_guest which allows the
	format to be specified for disk images.

	All the tools are changed to add an extra --format parameter allowing
	the format to be specified for direct disk images.

	fish: Specify format of disks (RHBZ#642934,CVE-2010-3851).

	format auto-detection.

2010-10-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Optional arguments, add-drive-opts (RHBZ#642934,CVE-2010-3851).
	This large commit changes the generator so that optional arguments
	can be supported for functions.

	The model for arguments (known as the "style") is changed from
	(ret, args) to (ret, args, optargs) where optargs is a more limited
	list of arguments.

	One function has been added which takes optional arguments, it is
	"add-drive-opts", modelled as:

	  (RErr, [String "filename"], #required
	         [Bool "readonly"; String "format"; String "iface"]) #optional

	Note that this function is processed in the library (does not go over
	the RPC protocol to the daemon).  This has allowed us to simplify
	the current implementation by omitting changes related to RPC or the
	daemon, although we plan to add these at some point in the future.

	From C this function can be called in 3 different ways as in these
	examples:

	  guestfs_add_drive_opts (g, filename,
	                          GUESTFS_ADD_DRIVE_OPTS_READONLY, 1,
				  GUESTFS_ADD_DRIVE_OPTS_FORMAT, "raw",
	                          -1);

	(the argument(s) between 'filename' and '-1' are the optional ones).

	  guestfs_add_drive_opts_va (g, filename, args);

	where 'args' is a va_list.  This works like the first version.

	  struct guestfs_add_drive_opts_argv optargs = {
	    .bitmask = GUESTFS_ADD_DRIVE_OPTS_READONLY_BITMASK,
	    .readonly = 1,
	  }
	  guestfs_add_drive_opts_argv (g, filename, &optargs);

	This last form lets you construct lists of optional arguments, and
	is used by guestfish and the language bindings.

	In guestfish optional arguments are used like this:

	  add-drive-opts filename readonly:true

	In OCaml these are mapped naturally to OCaml optional arguments, eg:

	  g#add_drive_opts ~readonly:true filename;

	In Perl these are mapped to extra arguments, eg:

	  $g->add_drive_opts ($filename, readonly => 1);

	In Python these are mapped to optional arguments, eg:

	  g.add_drive_opts ("file", readonly = 1, format = "qcow2")

	In Ruby these are mapped to a final hash argument, eg:

	  g.add_drive_opts("file", {})
	  g.add_drive_opts("file", :readonly => 1)
	  g.add_drive_opts("file", :readonly => 1, :iface => "virtio")

	In PHP these are mapped to extra parameters.  This is not quite
	accurate since you cannot omit arbitrary optional parameters, but
	there's not much than can be done within the limitations of PHP
	as a language.

	Unimplemented in: Haskell, C#, Java.

	df: Correctly quote libvirt domain and filesystem in --csv mode (RHBZ#639986).
	This fixes virt-df --csv when used with libvirt domains that contain
	quotes, spaces, commas and other lesser-used characters.

	virt-resize: Document qcow2 output format (RHBZ#642826).

	virt-resize: List truncate(1) in SEE ALSO section.

	tools: Add section describing quoting libvirt domain names to docs (RHBZ#643624)

	parted: Don't return "loop" for non-partitioned devices (RHBZ#634246).
	If you ran part-get-parttype command on a device which didn't
	contain a partition, it used to return the string "loop".  This
	is an internal representation that parted uses.  We should instead
	return an error because part-get-parttype makes no sense for
	devices which are not partitioned.

	contrib: Note about what needs to be done for visualization.

	todo: Add wishlist items to to-do list.

2010-10-06  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: Add note about using blktrace.

	contrib: More trace visualization.

	debug: Add qtrace <device> on|off to allow selective traces.

	part-disk: Align whole disk partition to 64 sectors.
	Change the part-disk command so it aligns the partition to
	64 sectors (instead of 1 or 34 sectors as now).  This should
	ensure that the filesystem contained within is aligned.

2010-10-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	contrib: Fix small mistake in README file.

	contrib: Update README files.

	contrib: Visualizing block device access and alignment.

2010-10-04  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ocaml: Add g#ocaml_handle method.

	ocaml: Document g#close () method for objects.

	ocaml: Create the handle when the object is instantiated.
	Previously we had only one handle shared between all objects .. oops.
	This fixes commit 67636f721056d2f2250b0ff8acd981a0294536a9.

2010-10-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ocaml: Add alternate object-oriented programming style.
	In original style:

	let () =
	  let filename = Sys.argv.(1) in
	  let g = Guestfs.create () in
	  Guestfs.add_drive_ro g filename;
	  Guestfs.launch g;
	  let roots = Guestfs.inspect_os g in
	  print_endline (Guestfs.inspect_get_product_name g roots.(0))

	The same code in the new OO style:

	let () =
	  let filename = Sys.argv.(1) in
	  let g = new Guestfs.guestfs in
	  g#add_drive_ro filename;
	  g#launch ();
	  let roots = g#inspect_os () in
	  print_endline (g#inspect_get_product_name roots.(0))

2010-10-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	test-copy: Skip this test if /dev/fd is missing, because of broken mock 1.1.4.

	test-virt-resize: Skip this test on 32 bit hosts.

2010-10-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.21.

2010-10-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Fix glob command (RHBZ#635969).
	This is a fix for the glob command in guestfish which was inadvertently
	broken in commit c359347dd42c9f5b875630537ee3641264826b89.

	This also appears to fix:
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=635969
	  glob echo mkfs ext2 /dev/vd[b-t]1 prints garbage

2010-09-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add test for virt-resize.
	This tests a number of things which have caused problems for us:

	 - resizing PVs and LV content
	 - handling GPT format disks
	 - using qcow2 as a target disk format
	 - shrinking disk images

	Note that the disk content is empty (not a real VM), but this is
	adequate since all we want to test are the operations and calculations
	done by virt-resize.  We are not interested here in whether e2fsprogs
	and LVM actually works.

2010-09-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize: Fix handling of GPT and qcow2 (RHBZ#633766, RHBZ#633096).
	Previously we copied the bootloader data directly from the
	source disk image to the target disk image using host file
	operations (before launching libguestfs).  This has two problems:
	firstly it has no chance of working with qcow2, and secondly
	it didn't behave properly with GPT.

	This changes the code so that everything is done through
	libguestfs.  Block device sizes are now calculated properly
	for qcow2 (RHBZ#633096) because this is done using the libguestfs
	blockdev_getsize64 call.  The partition table is still created
	by parted, but to workaround a bug in parted this is done before
	copying the bootloader.  Finally the bootloader copy is done
	using the new APIs pread-device and pwrite-device.

	Shrinking now works, at least for simple cases (RHBZ#633766).

2010-09-27  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: pread-device, partial read for devices.

	pread: Check count and offset parameters are not negative.

	Freshen POD (manual pages) stylesheet.

2010-09-26  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.20.

	New API: pwrite-device
	This is the same as the existing 'pwrite' API call, but allows you
	to write to a device.

	pwrite: Check offset is not negative.

	fish: Refresh guestfish documentation.

	Document ambiguity between devices and paths in API.

2010-09-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Document accurately how supermin appliance uses /tmp as a cache.

	Allow $TMPDIR to override most temporary directory uses.
	Be more consistent in allowing the user to override use of the
	temporary directory by specifying $TMPDIR.  Also prefer P_tmpdir
	macro (defined in <stdio.h>) if that is defined, rather than
	hard-coding "/tmp" for the fallback location.

	Call blockdev --rereadpt then udev_settle after sfdisk commands.
	This updates commit 956fc5a3feacc970ea763697bf28fb686c875408 so
	that we call udev_settle after rereading the partition table.  This
	ensures that the devices nodes for the new partitions have been
	created.

2010-09-23  Daniel Cabrera  <logan@fedoraproject.org>

	Update Spanish translations (RHBZ#636918).

2010-09-23  Piotr Drąg  <piotrdrag@gmail.com>

	Update Polish translations (RHBZ#502533).

2010-09-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.19.

2010-09-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	regressions: Test just-built guestfish.
	Instead of testing the installed /usr/bin/guestfish.

	This fixes commit ddda0f7bd00a37274dae38f4ce93955b8cfdf7d7.

2010-09-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Call blockdev --rereadpt after sfdisk commands.
	On fast machines sfdisk has some sort of race where it
	fails to re-read the partition table it has just created
	(it's not clear if this is a race in sfdisk, the kernel or
	some other component).

	This commit works around the problem by calling
	blockdev --rereadpt after sfdisk operations, which
	experience shows is enough to stop the problem from
	happening.

2010-09-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.18.

	Test guestfish -a and guestfish -d options.
	Since these options were both broken in released version 1.5.17,
	best to have a regression test to catch this in future.

2010-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Ignore unreadable dbus service file (Fedora 15).

2010-09-22  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Fix segfault in free_drives() function.
	This updates commit 8ea62c8d7f3f7f7e4057b93105cf979271aa13f4
	so it doesn't try to free the optarg (stack-allocated) strings.

2010-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.17.

	Update release notes for new features in 1.5 branch.

	fish: Implement 'hexedit' command.

	New APIs: upload-offset and download-offset
	These APIs allow you to efficiently write and read parts of
	files or devices.

2010-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	leak: Clear history before exiting guestfish.
	Clear the in-memory history before exiting.  This removes
	some but not all memory leaks associated with using the GNU
	History library.  As far as I can tell it is not possible to
	free up everything used by GNU History.

	(Found by valgrind).

2010-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	leak: Free list of drives and mountpoints in guestfish.
	Previously the list of -a, -d, -m, -N parameters were leaked.  This
	change frees them explicitly.

	This is not such an important fix since guestfish is a one-shot
	program, but it aids in finding other leaks in future.

	(Found by valgrind).

2010-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	leak: Free PCRE regexps when library is unloaded.
	The compiled PCRE regexps used for inspection were being leaked when
	the library was unloaded.

	(Found by valgrind).

2010-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	leak: Appliance name was leaked during guestfs_launch.
	This frees the string containing the name of the appliance
	which was previously being leaked during launch.

	(Found by valgrind).

2010-09-21  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Add more exclusions to .gitignore.

2010-09-21  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Fix appliance build dependency problem
	The appliance was being completely rebuilt every time guestfsd was updated. This
	was because make.sh depended on guestfsd, which it had to do because it
	called update.sh to install guestfsd.

	This fix removes the call to update.sh in make.sh, and therefore the dependency
	on guestfsd. The Makefile already includes a rule to run update.sh when guestfsd
	is updated, so this was unnecessary.

2010-09-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Add --echo-keys option to allow passphrases/keys to be echoed.
	See also:
	http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/26.17.html#subj13.3

2010-09-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	df: Add --one-per-guest option for using one appliance per guest.

2010-09-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix error launching libguestfs when euid != uid.
	When writing to a RHEV target, virt-v2v launches the libguestfs
	appliance with euid:egid = 36:36, which is required to write to
	an NFS target using root_squash.

	Since we changed to using a cached appliance, this causes an error on
	start up, as the cached files are owned by root, but the cache directory
	is owned by 36:36.  The reason is that bash resets euid to uid and
	egid to gid so when febootstrap-supermin-helper is executed, it runs as
	root:root.  The cache directory was created by libguestfs directly so
	it has the correct ownership.

	This patch fixes the issue by using explicit fork/exec instead of
	system (ie. not going via a shell) and by setting the real UID and
	GID to the effective UID and GID before execing.

2010-09-20  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: Suggest removing repo name from appliance name.

2010-09-18  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Generate guestfish-only commands.
	The guestfish-only commands such as 'alloc' and 'edit' are
	now generated from one place in the generator instead of being
	spread around ad-hoc in the C code.

	fish: In guestfish(1) turn command references into links.

2010-09-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Correction for online help for 'edit' and 'more' commands.
	This corrects commit b5c287bcd456bdb02d8ec0443483df34f4fd6b5d
	and commit 639ca1828b167bf59353f0cd3c8c79c6289bbd5d.

2010-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.16.

	configure: Make "fedora-13" the default repository.

	fish: If -m option fails, suggest a mountpoint.

	todo: Remove section since we now have list-filesystems API.

	Version 1.5.15.

2010-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: list-filesystems: list filesystems
	This API is a simpler replacement for the guestfish commands
	list-devices / list-partitions / lvs, in the case where you are
	just examining a guest by hand to see what it contains.

	Typical usage and output in guestfish is like this:

	$ guestfish --ro -a /dev/vg_trick/F13x64
	><fs> run
	><fs> list-filesystems
	/dev/vda1: ext4
	/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root: ext4
	/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_swap: swap

	It can also be used to replace programs that try to mount
	devices to determine if they are mountable filesystems.

2010-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: part-to-dev: Convert partition name to device name.
	This adds a formal API for going from a partition to the containing
	device, eg. /dev/sda1 -> /dev/sda

	generator: Add TestOutputDevice.
	This is for testing functions that return a device or partition
	name, so that we can compare the return value with the canonical
	device name (eg. "/dev/vda1" == "/dev/sda1").

	todo: More use of libblkid.

2010-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: In usage message use new-style -i option syntax.

	fish: Update copyright dates in usage message.

	fish: Remove extraneous space from usage message.

	todo: More ideas.

	Version 1.5.14.

	configure: Check for virtio-serial support in qemu.
	All other vmchannel methods are obsolete, but we were still trying
	to check for them.  This replaces all of them with a simple check
	for virtio-serial.

	pardus: Check for cpio in configure.

2010-09-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update Spanish translation (RHBZ#633357).

	build: Add run-test-tool-locally to EXTRA_DIST.

	Version 1.5.13.

	appliance: Disable setting scheduler to noop.
	This is a workaround until
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=630583
	is fixed (bug in Linux 2.6.36).

	ubuntu: Remove bogus debirf file.

	ubuntu: Add linux-image to the packagelist.
	It seems that linux-image (ie. the kernel) is omitted in some
	versions of the base packages.

	ubuntu: /proc can be a symlink
	If it's a symlink then the succeeding mount commnd will fail.
	Remove it and make a /proc directory.

	build: 'make quickcheck' rule now uses new run-test-tool-locally script.

2010-09-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	build: hivex is required.
	hivex library has been required since we moved the inspection
	code to C.  Check for this in configure.ac.

	Version 1.5.12.

	build: require Augeas for library.
	Augeas has been required since we moved the inspection code to C,
	however we were not correctly enforcing this in configure.ac, nor
	correctly linking to the library until now.

	generator: Provide no-op generator if no OCaml compiler.

	build: Don't distribute src/generator.ml, no longer exists.

2010-09-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Calculate MD5 of test.iso at runtime.
	Because this used to be compiled into the C test, it changed
	every time the ISO was rebuilt (which because of Makefile deps
	was every run).

	Now it is calculated at runtime so the C test file doesn't keep
	changing.

2010-09-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Don't use real uuidgen for UUIDs.
	This was one reason why capitests/tests.c changed every time the
	generator was run.

2010-09-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Split generator into separate source files.
	'src/generator.ml' is no more.  Instead the generator is logically
	split up over many different source files.

	Read generator/README for help and tips.

	We compile the generator down to bytecode, not native code.  This
	means it will run more slowly, but is done for maximum portability.

2010-09-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	syntax: Replace -a and -o with && and || for portability.

2010-09-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	syntax: Use exit (EXIT_SUCCESS) instead of hard-coded number.

	syntax: Remove unused assert.h header.

	syntax: Remove unused ignore-value.h header.

	syntax: Remove unused signal.h header.

	syntax: Remove unused c-ctype.h header.

	syntax: Fully bracket m4 macro arguments.

	syntax: Remove trailing spaces.

	syntax: Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.

	syntax: Replace _prohibit_regexp with _sc_search_regexp.

	fish: glob should only print commands when trace mode is enabled.

	fish: Add regression test for copy-in and copy-out.

	README: Document virtio-serial is now the only vmchannel.

	fish: const-correctness fixes in copy.c

	Version 1.5.11.

	Update OCaml dependencies.

	Update PO files.

	fish: Fix 'copy-out' command when local directory is "/foo".

	fish: Fix typo in documentation of copy-out.

2010-09-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.10.

	todo: Remove discussion of copy-in/copy-out.

	fish: Implement copy-in and copy-out commands.

	New APIs: is-chardev, is-blockdev, is-fifo, is-symlink, is-socket
	These complement the existing is-file and is-dir APIs.

	daemon: Move 'exists', 'is-file' and 'is-dir' to separate file.
	This commit is just code movement.

	generator: Fix incorrect shortdesc in docs for 'is-dir' command.

	generator: Fix documentation for 'is-file' command.

	fish: Fix 'more' command to work with any file.

	fish: Fix 'edit' command to work with any file.

	guestfs: Reference guestfs-browser architecture in threads documentation.

	guestfs: Document progress notification messages in protocol.

	guestfs: More accurate documentation for initial message.

	guestfs: Remove traces of documentation for non-existent 'low-level API'

	guestfs: Fix typo in man page.

	todo: Notes on virt copy command.

2010-09-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Bring TODO file up to date.

	Version 1.5.9.

	fish: Add guestfish -N bootroot and -N bootrootlv for creating boot+root disks.

	fish: Add guestfish -N lvfs for creating formatted LVs.

	fish: Add guestfish -N lv for creating disks with LVs.

	fish: Improve appearance of guestfish -N help output.

	fish: Allow guestfish -N help for listing prepared disk image help.

	fish: Generate list of prepared disk image types.
	This commit shouldn't change the semantics of the code.

2010-09-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	test-tool: Add a 'run-test-tool-locally' script.
	This can be used to run the test tool without installing it.
	It sets the environment variables and command line arguments
	up correctly to run the tool from the build directory.

	appliance: init script does 'ls -lR /dev' (verbose only)
	It's useful to see what files are in /dev subdirectories
	at boot, eg. for looking at virtio-serial ports.

	daemon: Don't warn about 'long long' usage.
	This removes a fatal warning (-Werror) which stops compilation
	on 32 bit machines.

2010-09-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	php: Remove 'make clean' rule in subdirectory.

2010-09-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.8.

	PHP bindings.
	Note that these are not complete on 32 bit architectures.  PHP doesn't
	offer any convenient 64 bit type (on 32 bit).  Therefore you should
	always use these PHP bindings on 64 bit.

2010-09-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Define LIBGUESTFS_HAVE_<shortname> for C API functions.
	The actions each have a corresponding define, eg:

	  #define LIBGUESTFS_HAVE_VGUUID 1
	  extern char *guestfs_vguuid (guestfs_h *g, const char *vgname);

	However functions which are for testing, debugging or deprecated do
	not have the corresponding define.  Also a few functions are so
	basic (eg. guestfs_create) that there is no point defining a symbol
	for them.

2010-09-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	build: guestfs-structs.h was missing from libguestfs_la_SOURCES.

	Add full docs pot file.

2010-09-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Allow manual pages and POD files to be translated.
	This uses the optional po4a package to split these files into
	PO files for translation, and reassemble afterwards.

	Note this creates an extra pot file (po-docs/libguestfs-docs.pot).
	We don't (yet) combine this with the main po/libguestfs.pot file.
	The 'libguestfs-docs.pot' file included in this commit is not the
	real thing, just a short cut down snippet for testing.  The real
	thing is created if you update one of the dependent files and
	rebuild.

	Note also the dummy ja.po, for testing the principles.

2010-09-02  Geert Warrink  <geert.warrink@onsnet.nu>

	Add Dutch translation (RHBZ#629593).

2010-09-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ruby: Add Guestfs::Guestfs.new() method.
	This is a more standard way to create objects in Ruby.  The old
	way was to call the module function Guestfs::create() which still
	works.

	perl: Document handle is a hashref.
	For details see commit eb566f7dc7974b42ac65729a2e5e5bcee329a0a9.

	perl: Add documentation about testing availability of methods and features.

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	build: Link static -ltinfo into guestfish.static binary.

	Version 1.5.7.

	fish: Add missing header file to sources.

	ocaml: Add test for progress notification callbacks.

	debug: Add 'debug progress' command.
	This debugging command generates progress notification messages,
	used for testing purposes.

	debug: Arrange prototypes in alphabetical order.

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Enable debug command by default.
	The debug command is useful for internal testing, and so should
	be enabled by default in all builds.

	Note that it is still *not* part of the stable ABI.

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Consistent use of 'void *opaque' to refer to opaque pointer in C API.
	We inconsistently used 'void *data' or 'void *opaque' all over to
	refer to the same thing.  Use 'void *opaque' in all places in the
	published API and documentation.

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize: Add progress bar to virt-resize.
	With this commit you will see a plain progress bar during the
	lengthy copy operations, similar to below:

	Summary of changes:
	/dev/sda1: partition will be left alone
	/dev/sda2: partition will be resized from 7.5G to 9.5G
	/dev/sda2: content will be expanded using the 'pvresize' method
	Copying /dev/sda1 ...
	[############################################################################]
	Copying /dev/sda2 ...
	[########################################------------------------------------]

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: bindings to progress callback.

	ocaml: bindings to progress callback.

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement private data area.
	The private data area is a hash table which is associated with
	libguestfs handles, that C callers may use to store arbitrary
	data for the lifetime of the handle.

	Later the OCaml bindings will use this in order to implement
	callbacks.

2010-09-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Implement progress bars in guestfish.
	The progress bar is updated 3 times per second, and is not displayed
	at all for operations which take less than two seconds.

	You can disable progress bars by using the flag --no-progress-bars,
	and you can enable progress bars in non-interactive sessions with
	the flag --progress-bars.

	A good way to test this is to use the following command:

	guestfish --progress-bars \
	          -N disk:10G \
	          zero-device /dev/sda

	(adjust "10G" to get different lengths of time).

	for the current terminal type.

	Add progress messages to download command.

	Add progress messages to zero-device command.

	Implement progress messages in the daemon and library.
	This implements progress notification messages in the daemon, and

2010-08-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	build: Don't add version extra string to the version number.
	If this string was non-empty, then it broke a lot of things because
	autoconf and other parts of the build system were expecting this
	string to contain a simple MAJOR.MINOR.RELEASE version number.

	This requires changes to guestfish and guestmount so they use the
	guestfs_version API to fetch the version from the library.  (The
	Perl tools were already doing it this way).  In a way this is more
	accurate, because it's no longer hard-coded in the binary, but
	fetched from the dynamically linked libguestfs.so.

	rescue: Fix typo in comment.

2010-08-26  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Ignore launch() error in virt-rescue. (RHBZ#618556)
	launch() expects guestfsd to start, which it never does in virt-rescue, so it
	always returns an error about the appliance shutting down unexpectedly.

2010-08-26  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Shut down the appliance cleanly
	When guestfsd exits, or the user exits the virt-rescue shell, the init script
	exits which causes the kernel to panic. This isn't really a functional issue, as
	all useful work is done by this point. However, it does cause virt-rescue to
	display an unsightly error message.

	This patch causes the appliance to power off cleanly before the init script
	exits. Note it actually does a reboot rather than a poweroff. This is because
	ACPI is disabled in the appliance, meaning poweroff doesn't work, but qemu is
	configured not to restart on reboot.

2010-08-26  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Call sync after guestfsd exits
	Core files are not reliably written to disk if guestfsd dumps core. This patch
	makes libguestfs do the same appliance cleanup for guestfsd and virt-rescue,
	which seems to fix the matter.

	It also removes a redundant sleep and additional sync when exiting virt-rescue.

2010-08-26  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Add a core_pattern debug command
	This adds a new debug command, core_pattern, which writes a new pattern for
	coredump files to the appliance kernel, and sets the daemon's hard and soft core
	limits to infinity.

2010-08-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Include statically linked binaries in the binary distribution.

	Rename global 'xdr_str'.
	Two bits of XDR both contained a definition called 'str' which
	means that 'xdr_str' was being exported globally twice.  Because
	of the linker script this didn't affect us.  But it's best to
	rename this global so that conflicts cannot arise.

2010-08-24  Daniel Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add -nodefconfig command line option to qemu.
	Without this option, qemu will read some defaults from /etc/qemu/

2010-08-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.4.

	New APIs: set-network and get-network to enable network support.
	guestfs_set_network (g, true) enables network support in the appliance.

	build: Add 'bindist' rule for building binary distribution.

	Don't print debug messages when not in verbose mode.
	Don't print them because no one's listening ...

	Change protocol to send Linux errno from daemon to library.
	This changes the protocol so that the Linux errno (if available)
	is sent back to the library.  Note that the errno is not yet
	made available to callers, since it is not clear how best to
	present this Linux-specific number.

2010-08-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Raise error message max size to 64K.
	This commit removes one of the protocol limits, by raising the
	maximum error message size from 256 bytes to 64K.

	Although we could consider raising this further, since the
	error messages are currently stored in fixed sized buffers on
	the stack, that would require more invasive code changes.

2010-08-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use virtio-serial, remove other vmchannel methods.
	This adds support for virtio-serial, and removes all other
	vmchannel methods.

	Virtio-serial is faster than other methods, and is now widely
	available.

	I tested this by using the guestfs_upload API on an 83 MB file:
	  before: 6.12 seconds (14.1 MB/sec)
	   after: 4.20 seconds (20.6 MB/sec)
	(note this is with the current 8K chunk size)

2010-08-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change to using ext2-based, cached supermin appliance.
	This changes the method used to build the supermin appliance
	to use the new ext2-based appliance supported by latest febootstrap.
	The appliance can also be cached, so we avoid rebuilding it
	each time it is used.

	Mailing list discussion goes into the rationale and details:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010-August/msg00028.html

	Requires febootstrap >= 2.8.

	Version 1.5.3

	Remove old ocaml-inspector code.
	Not used by anyone, didn't work well, and replaced now by the
	C inspection APIs.

2010-08-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Reimplement -i option using new C-based inspection.
	Don't shell out to virt-inspector.  Instead, use the new C-based
	inspection APIs.

	This is much faster.

	The new syntax is slightly different:

	  guestfish -a disk.img -i
	  guestfish -d guest -i

	However, the old syntax still works.

2010-08-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Add -c/--connect and -d/--domain options.
	The -d option lets you specify libvirt domains.  The disks from
	these domains are found and added, as if you'd named them with -a.

	The -c option lets you specify a libvirt URI, which is needed
	when we consult libvirt to implement the above.

2010-08-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs for guest inspection.
	This commit converts (some of) the Perl inspection code to C and
	makes it available through core APIs.  The new APIs are:

	inspect-os        - Does the inspection, returns list of OSes
	inspect-get-*     - Get results of the inspection

	where '*' is one of:

	  type            - 'windows' or 'linux'
	  distro          - Linux distro
	  arch            - architecture
	  product-name    - long product name string
	  major-version
	  minor-version   - major.minor version of OS
	  mountpoints     - get a list of the mountpoints
	  filesystems     - get all filesystems associated with the OS

	This works for all existing supported Linux and Windows OSes.

2010-08-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: findfs-label and findfs-uuid
	These two calls wrap up the /sbin/findfs command, allowing you
	to find a filesystem by only knowing its label or UUID.

	This is especially useful when resolving LABEL=... or UUID=...
	entries in /etc/fstab.

	Sample guestfish session:

	><fs> vfs-uuid /dev/vda1
	277dd61c-bf34-4253-a8dc-df500a05e7df
	><fs> findfs-uuid 277dd61c-bf34-4253-a8dc-df500a05e7df
	/dev/vda1
	><fs> vfs-label /dev/vda1
	/boot
	><fs> findfs-label /boot
	/dev/vda1
	><fs> vfs-uuid /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00

	><fs> findfs-uuid 40ce7c36-82ce-4a12-a99d-48f5e054162c
	/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00
	><fs> findfs-uuid 12345678
	libguestfs: error: findfs_uuid: findfs: unable to resolve 'UUID=12345678'

2010-08-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: file-architecture
	This change simply converts the existing Perl-only function
	file_architecture into a core API call.  The core API call is
	written in C and available in all languages and from guestfish.

	generator: No need to redefine safe_* macros.
	These are already defined in "guestfs-internal.h" which is
	included in the .c file.

	Add safe_strndup call.

2010-08-17  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Send trace output to stderr.
	Trace output sent to stdout can be lost in the event of a crash due to

2010-07-30  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: is-lv: check if a block device is a logical volume (RHBZ#619793)
	This adds a new API, guestfs_is_lv (g, device), which returns true iff
	the named device is an LVM2 logical volume.

	A sample guestfish session:

	><fs> lvs
	/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_root
	/dev/vg_f13x64/lv_swap
	><fs> list-devices
	/dev/vda

	Rename internal functions.
	This is an update to commit 41f25ab3df5f306ac717fa7a6efd58328d30c1ae.

	Internal functions should be named guestfs___* (3 underscores) to
	avoid clashing with the implementation of actions (2 underscores).

2010-07-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Rearrange library code into separate files.
	We split the library code into these separate files:

	 - guestfs.c: creating handles, closing handles, handle-related variables
	 - actions.c: generated library-side stubs for each action
	 - bindtests.c: generated code to test bindings
	 - launch.c: launching the appliance
	 - proto.c: the library side of the daemon communications protocol

	This is just code movement.

2010-07-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Rename guestfs-{actions,bindtests}.c to {actions,bindtests}.c
	Rename these two generated files, in preparation for splitting
	up the main src/guestfs.c file.

	TODO: Implement inspector code in C.

	TODO: Implement recursive upload/download in guestfish.

	TODO: Add link to discussion of progress bars.

2010-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.2.

2010-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	regressions: Don't print misleading 'Expect error ...' lines.
	Some tests in the regressions directory deliberately print
	error messages.  As long as they still PASS, this is OK.

	However these tests also printed some misleading messages
	about what error to expect.  Since error messages were slightly
	different across distros, these messages were not accurate.

	Therefore remove these messages, and replace with a general
	message before all tests telling users not to worry about
	errors from the tests as long as the tests don't fail.

2010-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: Support for creating LUKS and managing keys.
	This commit adds four APIs for creating new LUKS devices
	and key management.  These are:

	  luks_format         Format a LUKS device with the default cipher.
	  luks_format_cipher  Format with a chosen cipher.
	  luks_add_key        Add another key to an existing device.
	  luks_kill_slot      Delete a key from an existing device.

	This enables all the significant functionality of the
	cryptsetup luks* commands.

	Note that you can obtain the UUID of a LUKS device already
	by using vfs-uuid.

	This also includes a regression test covering all the LUKS
	functions.

2010-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Move variable initialization close to variable use.

2010-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Revert "add_drive_ro adds readonly=on option if available." (RHBZ#617200).
	Adding the readonly=on option is not so clever.  This causes
	qemu to present the disk as read-only to the guest.  (The
	expected behaviour of snapshots=on,readonly=on was that it
	would open the disk O_RDONLY but present a writable disk to
	the guest).

	Since the guest sees a read-only disk, we are unable to do any
	recovery if a filesystem on the disk is inconsistent.  This basically
	prevents most accesses to live disk images.

	What we really want is a qemu option which presents a writable
	disk to the guest, but only opens the disk on the host side with
	O_RDONLY, to alleviate the udev bug RHBZ#571714.

	This reverts commit 676462684e05dd8341dd695762dd99a87d8ec022.

2010-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Make documentation inside guestfish match man page.

2010-07-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.5.1.

2010-07-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: Support for opening LUKS-encrypted disks.
	This adds support for opening LUKS-encrypted disks, via
	three new APIs:

	  luks_open:    Create a mapping for an encrypted disk.
	  luks_open_ro: Same, but read-only mapping.
	  luks_close:   Close a mapping.

	A typical guestfish session using this functionality looks
	like this:

	  $ guestfish --ro -a encrypted.img
	  ><fs> run
	  ><fs> list-devices
	  /dev/vda
	  ><fs> list-partitions
	  /dev/vda1
	  /dev/vda2

	NOT included in this patch:

	 - An easier way to use this from guestfish.
	 - Ability to create LUKS devices.
	 - Ability to change LUKS keys on existing devices.
	 - Direct access to the /dev/mapper device (eg. if it contains
	   anything apart from VGs).

2010-07-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Add 'Key' parameter type.
	Add a 'Key' parameter type, used for passing sensitive key material
	into libguestfs.

	Eventually the plan is to mlock() key material into memory.  However
	this is very difficult to achieve because the encoded XDR strings
	end up in many places.  Therefore users should note that key material
	passed to libguestfs might end up in swap.

	The only difference between 'Key' and 'String' currently is that
	guestfish requests the key from /dev/tty with echoing turned off.

2010-07-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Remove unnecessary parameter.
	The 'name' parameter is not used on the right hand side of the

	df: Minimize the number of times we launch the libguestfs appliance.
	This commit greatly improves the performance of the 'virt-df'
	command by batching as many disks as possible onto a single appliance.
	In many situations this means the appliance is launched only once,
	versus one launch per domain as before.

	However doing it this way is a lot more complex:

	(1) Because of limits in Linux and virtio-blk, we can only attach
	26 disks maximum at a time to the appliance.

	(2) We have to use LVM filters (lvm-set-filter) to confine LVM to
	the disks of a single guest.

2010-07-16  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: lvm-set-filter and lvm-clear-filter.
	These APIs allow you to change the device filter, the list of
	block devices that LVM "sees".  Either you can set it to a fixed
	list of devices / partitions, or you can clear it so that LVM sees
	everything.

	Make tmp directory world readable (RHBZ#610880).
	If you have a restrictive umask (0077 for example) then
	files in the tmp directory would be created with 0600
	permissions.  Example:

	drwx------.  2 rjones rjones     4096 Jul  2 17:52 .
	drwxrwxrwt. 57 root   root     102400 Jul  2 17:52 ..
	-rw-------.  1 rjones rjones 86328832 Jul  2 17:52 initrd

	This in itself is not a problem.  However in virt-v2v we also
	change UID:GID and the result is that qemu is unable to read
	the initrd file:

	qemu: could not load initial ram disk '/tmp/libguestfs2ssynP/initrd'

	With this patch we make the tmp directory and the files
	world readable.  After the patch:

	$ ls -la /tmp/libguestfsJFVzPg/
	total 116192
	drwxr-xr-x.  2 rjones rjones      4096 Jul  2 18:03 .

	before releasing the thread lock.  Updated code looks like this:

	  char *filename = guestfs_safe_strdup (g, String_val (filenamev));
	  int r;

	  caml_enter_blocking_section ();
	  r = guestfs_add_drive_ro (g, filename);
	  caml_leave_blocking_section ();
	  free (filename);
	  if (r == -1)
	    ocaml_guestfs_raise_error (g, "add_drive_ro");

	Also included is a regression test.

2010-06-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Add explicit close() method (RHBZ#602592).
	This add an optional explicit $g->close method which may be
	used to force the handle to be closed immediately.  Note the
	provisos about this method in the manual page entry.  Callers
	should *not* normally use this method.

	The implementation of the handle also changes.  Before, the
	handle was a blessed reference to an integer (the integer
	being the pointer to the C guestfs_h handle).  Now we change
	this to a hashref containing currently the following field:

	  _g => pointer to C guestfs_h handle (as an integer)

	If this field is not present, it means that the handle has been
	explicitly closed.  This avoids double-freeing the handle.

	The user may add their own fields to this hash in order to store
	per-handle data.  However any fields whose names begin with
	an underscore are reserved for use by the Perl bindings.

	This commit also adds a regression test.

	This commit also changes the existing warning when you call
	a method without a Sys::Guestfs handle as the first parameter,
	into an error.  This is because such cases are always errors.

2010-06-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-df: Disallow -h and --csv options together (RHBZ#600977).
	Before this commit, if you used the -h and --csv options together
	you would get these warnings from virt-df:

	$ virt-df -h --csv Guest
	Virtual Machine,Filesystem,Size,Used,Available,Use%
	Argument "13.5G" isn't numeric in printf at /home/rjones/d/libguestfs/tools/virt-df line 298.
	Argument "4.7G" isn't numeric in printf at /home/rjones/d/libguestfs/tools/virt-df line 298.
	Argument "8.1G" isn't numeric in printf at /home/rjones/d/libguestfs/tools/virt-df line 298.
	"/dev/vg_trick/RHEL55x64","/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00",13,4,8,34.8%
	Argument "98.7M" isn't numeric in printf at /home/rjones/d/libguestfs/tools/virt-df line 298.
	Argument "18.8M" isn't numeric in printf at /home/rjones/d/libguestfs/tools/virt-df line 298.
	Argument "74.9M" isn't numeric in printf at /home/rjones/d/libguestfs/tools/virt-df line 298.
	"/dev/vg_trick/RHEL55x64","/dev/vda1",98,18,74,19.0%

	We could fix this so that the human-readable numbers get written
	into the CSV file.  However would probably be wrong for most uses
	of the CSV format (databases and spreadsheets) since they would not
	be able to interpret these human-readable numbers, or worse could
	misinterpret, eg. thinking that "1M" and "1G" are both 1.

	Therefore this commit disallows this combination of options.

2010-06-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	file: Fix file command on /dev/VG/LV paths (RHBZ#582484).
	Previous commit 4df593496e116dfb635731c058b7627e81fc179c broke the
	"file" command on logical volume paths, since these are symbolic
	links.  We *should* follow these (only).

	This inadvertantly broke virt-inspector too, which indicates that
	we need more regression testing in this area.  Since carrying whole
	Fedora images around could make the distribution even larger than
	now, I'm not sure at the moment how to do this.

	Thanks to Matt Booth for diagnosing this bug.

2010-06-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use the noop scheduler inside the appliance.
	In my limited tests, this seems to make a small but noticable
	difference, improving the performance of some straightforward
	read operations by a little over 10%.

2010-06-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.19.
	Update BUGS and PO files.

2010-06-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	file: Restrict to regular files (RHBZ#582484).
	The file call can hang if called on char devices (because we are
	using the file -s option).

	This is hard to solve cleanly without adding another file API.

	However this restricts file to regular files, unless called explicitly
	with a /dev/ path.  For non-regular files, it will now return a
	string like "directory".

	There is a small semantic change for symbolic links.  Previously
	it would not have worked at all on absolute links (or rather, the
	results would have been undefined).  It would have treated relative
	symlinks to regular files as the regular file itself.  Now it will
	return the string "symbolic link" in both cases.

	This commit also makes the API safe when called on untrusted
	filesystems.  Previously a filesystem might have been set up so
	that (eg) /etc/redhat-release was a char device, which would have
	caused virt-inspector and virt-v2v to hang.  Now it will not hang.

2010-06-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	touch: Restrict touch to regular files only (RHBZ#582484).

2010-06-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Rearrange code in 'file' command.
	  path = path to access file (/sysroot/.. or /dev/..)
	  display_path = original path, saved so we can display it
	  buf = optional buffer which is freed along return codepaths

	There should be no change to the semantics of the code.

2010-06-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	gnulib: Ignore asm-underscore.m4 in the correct place.

	Update to latest gnulib.

2010-06-03  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	mkfs-b: Map block size to cluster size for VFAT and NTFS partitions (RHBZ#599464).
	This also adds a regression test for VFAT and (conditionally)
	NTFS filesystems.

	mkfs-b: Check that blocksize parameter is > 0 and a power of 2.

2010-06-03  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Allow individual tests to depend on daemon features.
	Using IfAvailable "featurename" we allow individual tests to
	only run if the feature is available in the daemon.

	This will allow us to extend testing to a lot more optional
	features such as NTFS.

2010-06-03  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tests: Factor out common code into 'is_available' function.
	This commit is just code motion.

	grub-install: Enable grub-install tests and create explicit device.map file.

	grub-install: In docs suggest manually creating device.map (RHBZ#484986).

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.18.
	Update BUGS and PO files.

	RHEL 6: sr_mod.ko is needed for RHEL 6 to see CD-ROM devices (RHBZ#598807).

	parted: Check partition number >= 1 in several calls.

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Parse output of old parted which didn't support -m option (RHBZ#598309).
	This fixes the following commands when run with RHEL 5-era parted:

	  get-bootable
	  get-parttype
	  part-list

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: count_strings function returns size_t

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	base64-in: Ignore garbage characters in input.
	On RHEL 5 you have to specify the -i option to get the
	external 'base64' command to ignore \n characters.  (The
	Fedora version seems to ignore these characters anyway).

	Add this option so the tests can pass on RHEL 5.

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	resize2fs: Document this command also works with ext4 (thanks Yufang Zhang).

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: help command return error for non-existent commands (RHBZ#597145).
	With this change, the exit status indicates error for non-existent
	commands.

	$ guestfish -h foo
	foo: command not known, use -h to list all commands
	$ echo $?
	1
	$ guestfish help foo
	foo: command not known, use -h to list all commands
	$ echo $?
	1

2010-06-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: write-file: Check range of size parameter (RHBZ#597135).
	This also adds a regression test.

	daemon: Limit label lengths (RHBZ#597118).

	Update BUGS and PO files.

2010-06-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix and deprecate get_e2label and get_e2uuid (RHBZ#597112).
	Fix these calls (see description in RHBZ#597112), but also
	deprecate them since the new calls vfs_label and vfs_uuid can
	work on any filesystem type.

	This also adds a regression test for the original bug reported
	in RHBZ#597112.

2010-06-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: vfs-label and vfs-uuid return label and uuid for many fs types.
	These APIs generalize the existing 'get-e2label' and 'get-e2uuid'
	calls, to provide calls which should be able to get the label
	and UUID for most filesystem types.  These use 'blkid' to do the
	work.

	I have tested that the blkid commands themselves work on RHEL 5.

	(Suggested by Yufang Zhang).

2010-06-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Kill blkid cache to improve reliability of blkid commands.
	By killing the cache file, we make blkid work in situations such
	as a just-created filesystem.

	daemon: Generalize the implementation of vfs-type.
	Note that there is no change to the semantics of the code.

2010-05-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	todo: Should generate -N option.

	todo: Remove implemented resize functions from TODO file.

2010-05-27  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make the supermin appliance include local augeas lenses

2010-05-27  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Rely on new augeas lens for modules.conf and conf.modules
	Latest augeas includes a lens for /etc/modules.conf. If this new lens is
	present, the code to force the Modprobe lens to try to match /etc/modules.conf
	as well results in /etc/modules.conf not being parsed at all. This results in
	modprobe_aliases in virt-inspector output being empty.

	This change is equivalent to change cfd28d1140393667913689b7b9bcf21c8bfe592c
	from virt-v2v.

	An effect of this change is that the Modules_conf augeas lens is now required
	for correct operation on guests which use /etc/modules.conf.

	Fixes RHBZ#596776

2010-05-27  Daniel Cabrera  <logan@fedoraproject.org>

	Updates to Spanish translation (RHBZ#596763).

2010-05-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.17.

	Fix documentation for vfs-type to reflect reality.

	Clarify documentation on distro backports in version command.

	Add reference to version number documentation to version command.

	Clarify sparse behaviour of truncate-size command.

	Fix typo in documentation of guestfs_readlinklist.

	Fix missing word in docuentation of guestfs_readdir.

	Revise documentation on creating files.

	New API: fallocate64 (replaces fallocate).
	guestfs_fallocate takes an integer for the length, effectively
	limiting it to creating 1GB files.  This new call takes an int64_t
	for the length, but is otherwise identical.

2010-05-26  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix typo in description of echo-daemon command.

2010-05-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.16.

	Add bash complation script to EXTRA_DIST.

	Version 1.3.15.

	Add tests for available-all-groups command.

	fish: First pass at guestfish bash completion script.

	fish: Don't eat words when completing case-insensitive paths (RHBZ#582993).

	fish: Sort returned paths so the list is stable across multiple calls.

	fish: Document test1.img, test2.img etc used by -N option in FILES section.

	fish: Create a separate FILES section in the manpage.

	fish: Move 'EXIT CODE' section to a more logical place in the documentation.

	resize: Refresh the examples in the documentation.
	The documentation was previously very intimidating.  Bring some
	common, simple examples up to the top of the page in a separate
	section.

	fish: Make the read/write warning more prominent.
	Follow the example on other manual pages by making the warning
	more prominent.

2010-05-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: New command: 'supported'
	This checks all available optional groups and prints out which
	ones are supported by the daemon.  Note you must launch the appliance
	first.

	Example:

	><fs> supported
	      augeas yes
	     inotify yes
	 linuxfsuuid yes
	linuxmodules yes
	 linuxxattrs yes
	        lvm2 yes
	       mknod yes
	      ntfs3g yes
	   ntfsprogs yes
	    realpath yes
	       scrub yes
	     selinux yes
	          xz yes
	    zerofree yes

2010-05-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: available-all-groups to return list of all optional groups.

	perl: Rerun configure if MAX_PROC_NR changes.
	If MAX_PROC_NR changes (because a new API has been added to the
	generator) then we need to rerun configure in order to set the
	Makefile's ${MAX_PROC_NR} variable, in order to rebuild Makefile.PL.

2010-05-25  Piotr Drąg  <piotrdrag@gmail.com>

	Update Polish translations (RHBZ#502533).

2010-05-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.14.

	build: Remove install_kernel from EXTRA_DIST.
	This updates commit a34fadf900625f1f7359ecf3ca760820ffa20815,
	removing this now non-existent script from EXTRA_DIST.

	build: For development releases, print a notice.

2010-05-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfs_version: Correct documentation.
	Remove reference to 'ELF weak linking tricks' and replace
	with suggestion to use dl* functions.

2010-05-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Build workaround for Python 2.4.x in RHEL 5.
	See:
	http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0353/#conversion-guidelines

	C99 compatible build fix for RHEL 5.

2010-05-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: ntfsresize-size to allow shrinking NTFS (RHBZ#585223).

	New API: pvresize-size to allow shrinking PVs (RHBZ#585222).

	New API: resize2fs-size to allow shrinking ext2 filesystems (RHBZ#585221).

2010-05-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Allow suffixes on number parameters (eg. 1M)
	This small change uses the gnulib xstrtoll functionality to
	enable suffixes on integer parameters in guestfish.  For example:

	 truncate-size /file 1G

	(previously you would have had to given the full number).

	This also applies to the 'alloc' and 'sparse' commands (and
	indirectly to the -N option).  The specification for these commands
	has changed slightly, in that 'alloc foo 1MB' would now use SI
	units, allocating 1000000 bytes instead of a true megabyte.  All
	existing uses would use 'alloc foo 1M' which still allocates true
	megabytes.

2010-05-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Fix '-N part' disk partition type sub-option.

	TODO: Suggest including undelete utility.

	Fix name of update-bugs script in output file BUGS.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ubuntu: Use direct udevd method to start udev on Ubuntu.
	On Ubuntu, /etc/init.d/udev is a symlink to an upstart file,
	but running that causes the appliance to hang.

	Therefore detect if this is a symlink and fall through to the
	direct start of udevd.  This shouldn't affect Debian because the
	file is not a symlink on standard Debian.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ubuntu: Remove two FUSE packages from the default list.
	fuse-utils (a dependency of these) cannot be installed under
	debirf because it does something with the system udevd which is
	not permitted.  Seems to be a bug either in fakeroot or in the
	post install scripts for fuse-utils.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	ubuntu: Ignore packages in packagelist.in which are missing.
	For distros using 'yum', packages which cannot be found are just
	ignored.  This allows us to include for example 'e4fsprogs' on the
	list even though that only exists on RHEL 5.

	However for Debian-derived distros, missing packages would cause
	apt to fail.  This was particularly a problem when building Ubuntu
	since it doesn't have as complete a list of packages, and the list
	changed a lot between releases.

	This commit adds a check first for missing packages, ignoring those
	and thus acting more like 'yum'.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@ubuntu910x64.home.annexia.org>

	Ubuntu: Use apt-get instead of aptitude when installing guestfsd.

	Ubuntu: Revert install-kernel to debirf default script.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Make 'xz' into an optional group.
	On Ubuntu <= Karmic, xz-utils was not packaged, and therefore
	any xz-related tests would fail.  Thus make this an optional
	group so that we can test for this and avoid running the tests
	if xz utils are not present.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Check parameters are not NULL (RHBZ#501893).
	This adds additional tests to check that several types of parameter
	including String are not NULL when passed to the C functions.
	Previously this would cause a segfault inside libguestfs.  With
	this change, you get an error message / exception.

	Of the possible pointer parameters, only OptString is now permitted
	to be NULL.

	This change does not affect the Perl bindings.  This is because Perl
	XS code was already adding similar checks if you passed undef into
	a parameter expecting a string.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Some String parameters should be OptString (RHBZ#501894).
	I haven't checked the list of functions exhaustively, but
	these are the obvious ones.

	fuse: Implement write syscall (RHBZ#592883).

	New API: Implement pwrite system call (partial fix for RHBZ#592883).

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: write for creating files with fixed content (RHBZ#501889).
	The guestfs_write call can be used to create small files with
	arbitrary 8 bit content, including \0 bytes.

	This replaces and deprecates write-file, which cannot be modified
	to use BufferIn because of an unfortunate choice in the ABI: the
	size parameter to write-file, if zero, means that the daemon tries
	to calculate the length of the buffer using strlen.  However this
	fails if we pass a zero-length buffer using BufferIn because then
	the daemon tries to do strlen on a (really) zero length buffer, not
	even containing a terminating \0 character, thus segfaulting.

2010-05-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Implement BufferIn parameter type (RHBZ#501889).
	The BufferIn argument turns into various things:

	 in C      const char *, size_t parameter pair

	 in XDR    an opaque<> type (instead of string) which allows \0 chars

	 in other bindings
	           mostly just a string, since most languages except for C
	           permit strings to contain any 8 bit data

	Improve errors from tar-in/tgz-in commands (RHBZ#591155 RHBZ#591250).
	This commit improves the error messages from the tar-in, tgz-in (etc)
	commands by capturing the stderr from the tar command in a file and
	sending that back in the error message.

	The method used for the error file is primitive, and there is a case
	for a more generic error file mechanism, but this will do for now.

	Sample error messages after this change:

	$ virt-tar -u /tmp/test1.img /tmp/not.tar /
	tar_in: tar subcommand failed on directory: /: tar: This does not look like a tar archive
	tar: Skipping to next header

	Fix FileIn cmds losing synch if both ends send cancel messages (RHBZ#576879).
	During a FileIn command (eg. upload, tar-in) if both sides
	experience errors, then both sides could send cancel messages,
	the result being lost synchronization.

	The reason for the lost synch was because the daemon was ignoring
	this case and sending an error message back which the library side
	(which had cancelled) was not expecting.

	Fix this by checking in the daemon for the case where the library
	also cancels during daemon cancellation, and not sending an error
	messages.

	This also includes an enhanced regression test which checks for this
	case.

	This extends the original fix in
	commit 5922d7084d6b43f0a1a15b664c7082dfeaf584d0.

2010-05-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Fix build error in 'print_shell_quote' function.
	Amend commit 1c6ed48bd3cd471dc so the prototype of
	'print_shell_quote' function is correct.

	fish: Fix guestfish -N option when called with unknown image type.
	Previously it was falling off the end of the loop if you
	called it with an unknown image type.

	Improved error if virt-inspector cannot find OSes in image (RHBZ#591142).

	Fix error message in string-e command (RHBZ#588651).

2010-05-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfish -i and virt-inspector work on filenames containing spaces (RHBZ#507810).
	This commit fixes a long-standing bug which prevented guestfish -i
	and virt-inspector from working on disk images which had a space
	in the filename (or other unsafe characters).  It works by ensuring
	that the strings passed between guestfish -i and virt-inspector are
	quoted correctly in both directions.

	Note that this commit adds a dependency from virt-inspector to
	the perl module String::ShellQuote.  We have previously used this
	module in virt-make-fs.

2010-05-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add version numbers to Perl modules (RHBZ#521674).
	Sys::Guestfs now contains a version number which reflects the
	ABI that we are compiled against, ie. '0.<MAX_PROC_NR>'.  This has
	the beneficial side effect of causing an error if the user tries
	to mix versions of the Perl module and the XS code.

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib now contains a synthetic version number which
	will reflect future changes in that module.

2010-05-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files, including extra strings from Perl files.

2010-05-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	po: Include strings from Perl programs in the PO files (RHBZ#559963).
	xgettext will only recognize '*.pl' as being a Perl file (otherwise
	it treats it as a C file and does not correctly find any strings
	in it).

	This commit also fixes two actual bugs that xgettext found in the
	strings in our Perl programs.

2010-05-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	po: Don't generate po/Makevars file and include Perl keywords (RHBZ#559963).
	I don't see a reason to autogenerate po/Makevars, and in the
	earlier commit which changed this file to being autogenerated
	we accidentally lost the special Perl keywords, copyright notice
	and bug reporting address.  Fix all of that.

	This partially reverts commit febff9d2a35c4f40abbaf8943146476bdeac671e.

2010-05-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Reduce imported functions in virt-df to ones which are actually used.

	New API: fill-pattern for creating files with predefined patterns.

	Run udev_settle() after swapon/swapoff (RHBZ#516096).

	fish: With both '-x' and '-i', pass through '-x' to inferior process.

2010-05-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.11.

	virt-rescue: Add extra options.
	This commit adds the extra options '--append', '--memsize' and '--selinux'.

	virt-rescue: Refresh documentation.

	Revert "fish: Add 'please wait' message when launching (and interactive)."
	This reverts commit 01fedcde05c930c1413e9fe0909fa1da1f360cdf.

	fish: Add 'please wait' message when launching (and interactive).

	launch: Rearrange the code so config check is first.
	Move the config state check first in the guestfs_launch function,
	so that we don't reset g->launch_t or calculate the temporary
	directory in the case where the launch function will immediately
	return with an error.

	generator: FishAction is no longer used, remove this feature.

	fish: Make 'launch' function static.
	This commit makes the launch function static and private to
	'fish.c', and changes the generator so the function is no longer
	called for the 'run/launch' command.

	fish: In 'reopen' copy trace setting to new handle.

	Ignore test1.img file in directory.

	fish -N option unconditionally overwrites test*.img files.
	This is more convenient and makes it consistent with the
	'alloc' and 'sparse' commands.

	fish: Make '-x' option enable traces instead of using separate echo path.
	Previously we had separate code paths for echoing commands (-x)
	and tracing (guestfs_set_trace).  This just unifies that so that
	the guestfish -x option enables tracing.

2010-05-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspector: Support filesystem-on-image VMs (RHBZ#590167).
	$ virt-df /tmp/dbroot.img

	daemon: Use 'error' instead of 'perror' before calling 'abort'.

	daemon: gnulib module 'error' is used directly by the daemon.

	daemon: Use parens around code section for safety.

	If qemu dies during launch, set an error message (RHBZ#588851).

	Version 1.3.10.

2010-05-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Fix read-file so it fails gracefully for large files (RHBZ#589039).
	Pengzhen Cao noticed that read-file would fail for files
	larger than the protocol size; this is *not* the bug.  However
	it would also lose protocol synchronization after this.

	The reason was that functions which return RBufferOut in the
	generator must not 'touch' the *size_r parameter along error
	return paths.

	I fixed read-file and initrd-cat, and I checked that pread was
	doing the right thing.

	This also adds regression tests for read-file with various categories
	of large file.

2010-05-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Fix wc* commands to work on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).

	daemon: Fix strings to work on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).

	daemon: Fix head and tail commands to work on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).

	daemon: Fix grep and related to work on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).

	daemon: Fix checksum to work on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).

	daemon: Fix hexdump to work on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).

2010-05-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Fix for commands working on absolute symbolic links (RHBZ#579608).
	The original idea (suggested by Al Viro) was to fork and chroot
	into the sysroot and read the file from there.  Because of the
	separate process being chrooted, absolute links would be resolved
	correctly.  The slightly modified idea is to open the file in the
	daemon process (but temporarily chrooted, so symlinks resolve
	correctly), fork, and have the subprocess just be responsible for
	copying the file.  (Strictly speaking we don't need to fork, but
	this implementation is simpler).

	This commit just includes the changes needed to the command*()
	functions in daemon/guestfsd.c and adds an absolute symlink to
	the test ISO for testing it.  Later commits will fix the broken
	daemon commands themselves.

2010-05-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Change command to abort() on resource problems.
	The comment in the code describes it thus:

	  /* Note: abort is used in a few places along the error paths early
	   * in this function.  This is because (a) cleaning up correctly is
	   * very complex at these places and (b) abort is used when a
	   * resource problem is indicated which would be due to much more
	   * serious issues - eg. memory or file descriptor leaks.  We
	   * wouldn't expect fork(2) or pipe(2) to fail in normal
	   * circumstances.
	   */

	Use link-local addresses between appliance and host (RHBZ#588763).

2010-05-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change network configuration to use macros.
	Change the network configuration so everything is set using
	some macros at the top of src/guestfs.c.

	Also, rename the macros used in the daemon so they are not the
	same.  It was a very long time since these sets of macros had to
	match the ones defined in src/guestfs.c, despite what the comment
	said.

	Note that this commit should not change the semantics of the
	program at all.

2010-05-04  Daniel Cabrera  <logan@fedoraproject.org>

	Update Spanish translations (RHBZ#588733).

2010-04-30  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Document that guestfs_mount implies -o sync and performance problem (RHBZ#587582).

	contrib: Add dependency diagram of libguestfs ecosystem.

	contrib: Add header to README file.

	lvresize: Use --force so it can make LVs smaller (RHBZ#587484).
	This also adds a regression test for this bug.

	docs: Routine refresh of the documentation for guestfs(3) and guestfish(1).

2010-04-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.7 - note: fixes a segfault in guestfish 1.3.6.

	todo docs: Discuss shrinking filesystems and specifying sizes in guestfish.

	New API: checksums-out for checksumming many files.
	Useful API for verifying the integrity of virtual machines.

	generator: Update docs for checksum to point to checksum-device.

	daemon: Split out checksum type to program name mapping into function.
	This shouldn't change the semantics of the program.

	fish: Fix segfault in '-a' option.
	This fixes a segfault in the guestfish -a option which you would
	get when using guestfish 1.3.6.

	todo docs: Integrate with host intrusion detection systems.

	todo docs: Mapping filesystems to and from disk blocks.

2010-04-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.6.

2010-04-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Add -N option for making prepared disk images.
	Previously you might have typed:

	$ guestfish
	><fs> alloc test1.img 100M
	><fs> run
	><fs> part-disk /dev/sda mbr
	><fs> mkfs ext4 /dev/sda1

	now you can do the same with:

	$ guestfish -N fs:ext4

	Some tests have also been updated to use this new
	functionality.

2010-04-22  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Whitelist the loop kernel module
	loop is sometimes a module, for example on RHEL 5.

2010-04-21  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Don't die during inspection if rpm -qa or dpkg-query fails
	If a problem in the package database prevented package enumeration from working,
	inspection would die. This change makes it emit a warning and continue.

	Don't die during inspection if initrd doesn't exist
	This fixes a problem where inspection would die if grub.conf referenced a
	non-existent initrd. Just return an empty initrd instead.

2010-04-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add zfs-fuse (ZFS via FUSE) support to the appliance.

	Remove checks for Test::Pod and Test::Pod::Coverage.
	Although these modules are optionally used by the Perl tests,
	they aren't necessary and won't break the build if they are not
	there.  These modules aren't available in RHEL 5.  Therefore
	remove these checks.

2010-04-20  Daniel Cabrera  <logan@fedoraproject.org>

	Updated Spanish translations (RHBZ#584038).

2010-04-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Check user doesn't run configure, make or make check as root.
	(Thanks to Yufang Zhang for helping to debug this issue).

	Replace 'dd' in tests with use of guestfish 'sparse' command.
	'dd' is a very inefficient way to create files.  'truncate' is
	better, but unfortunately that command is not available in RHEL 5.
	So use the guestfish 'sparse' command instead (which also avoids
	allocating disk space).

2010-04-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files.

	Prepare for version 1.3.5.

	New APIs: base64-in and base64-out for uploading/downloading base64 content.

2010-04-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: debug-upload (not a formal part of the API/ABI).
	Allow arbitrary files to be uploaded into the appliance, but
	only when --enable-debug-command is enabled.  This lets you
	run shell scripts, like this:

	  ><fs> debug-upload -<<EOF /tmp/script.sh 0700
	  #!/bin/sh -
	  # ...
	  EOF
	  ><fs> debug sh "/tmp/script.sh"

2010-04-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Allow -<<END as a syntax for uploading "heredocs".
	For example:

	    ><fs> upload -<<END /foo
	    some data
	    some more data
	    END
	    ><fs> cat /foo
	    some data

	todo docs: Feature for base64 uploads and scripts.

	docs: Add virt-resize(1) link to guestfish(1) manpage.

2010-04-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.4

	todo documentation: Idea: List, mount filesystems by UUID and label.

	todo documentation: remove 'virt-grow/shrink', see virt-resize

	todo documentation: virt-rescue now uses $TERM from library, remove from todo list

	todo documentation: Remove old section on PPC bugs.
	No one cares for PPC, and if they do they should file these
	as bugs in the bug tracker.

	todo documentation: Remove old ideas for Python bindings.

	Documentation: Use 'g' instead of 'handle' in documentation.
	By convention we use 'g' for handles.  Copy this convention
	through to all the documentation.

	In guestfs(3), unmount "/" directory in the example.

	Add compilation/linking example to guestfs(3) man page.

	generator: Use shortname in check_state() call.
	Saves a tiny bit of space in the library.

	Build top-level directories in a more logical order.

	Rerun generator if images/test.iso does not exist or has been updated.
	The MD5 hash of this file is embedded in the output of the
	generator.

2010-04-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix upload losing synchronization if root not mounted (RHBZ#576879).
	Modify the generator so that it can correctly handle early
	cancellation for Pathname|Device|.. parameters.  This fixes
	the upload command, but consequently we need to fix the
	parameters for tar_in and t?z_in commands.  This should also
	mean that 'win:' can now be used as the second argument of
	tar_in and t?z_in commands in guestfish, whereas previously
	this wouldn't have worked.

	Adds a regression test for the original problem.

2010-04-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Fix typo in a comment.

2010-04-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Improved checking, documentation of modes (RHBZ#582901, RHBZ#582929).
	chmod: Disallow negative mode, document mode affected by umask.

	mkdir-mode: Disallow negative mode, document that filesystems
	may interpret the mode in different ways.

	mknod: Disallow negative mode, document mode affected by umask.

	umask: Check the range of umask mask value carefully.

2010-04-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Autocomplete 'sparse' command (RHBZ#582899).
	I also rechecked the list of built-in commands against
	the actual commands to make sure no others were omitted.

	New API: get-umask, returns the current umask (RHBZ#582891).

	Add a build test for the 'umask' command.

	fish: Print output from some commands in octal/hex as approp. (RHBZ#583242).

	Documentation: lvcreate should say 'logical volume' (RHBZ#582953)

2010-04-14  Daniel Cabrera  <logan@fedoraproject.org>

	Update Spanish translations (RHBZ#582252).

	Fix build error in fuse/guestmount.c.
	guestmount.c: In function 'main':
	guestmount.c:899: error: implicit declaration of function 'setlocale'
	[-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

	guestmount.c wasn't including locale.h.

2010-04-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: Add aug-clear call for clearing an Augeas node.

2010-04-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Allow '-' prefix on command line to override exit on error (RHBZ#578407).
	Allow -cmd on the command line to mean that normal exit on error
	behaviour is overridden, ie. we will not exit.

	This allows you to do:

	  guestfish -- command : -command : command

	with the second command allowing errors.  (Note that '--' is required
	to stop getopt parsing -command as an option).

	Also this fixes the remote case which is what the original
	bug report was about.

2010-04-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	fish: Update documentation: Add another pipe example.

	fish: Update documentation: Using 'lcd' command to change local directory.

2010-04-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files.

	Prepare for version 1.3.3.

	resize: Add --LV-expand option for expanding Linux LVs.

	New API: lvresize-free to extend LVs into percentage of free space.

	Fix time and timezone to be correct within the appliance.

	resize: Fix missing newline from end of print.

	resize: Fix regular expression to exactly match ^ext[234]$

	virt-resize: Mention alternate tools like gparted in the documentation.

2010-04-12  Daniel Cabrera  <logan@fedoraproject.org>

	Updated Spanish translation (RHBZ#581501).

2010-04-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Documentation updates.
	Fix copyright years.
	Fix URLs to point to new PRC site.
	Make sure guestfish(1) and guestfs(3) manpages reference the
	current list of tools.

2010-04-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.3.2

	New API: checksum-device for checksumming devices.
	Analogous to the usual 'checksum' call.

2010-04-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-resize: Enhance virt-resize so it can expand partition content.
	Enhance virt-resize so it can expand "first level" partition
	content, including ext/2/3/4/ntfs filesystems and PVs.

	Also extensively update the documentation.

	This has been tested on a variety of Linux and Windows guests.

2010-04-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	virt-list-partitions: Add -t / --total option.
	This option lists out block devices separately:

	 $ virt-list-partitions -lht /tmp/WindowsResized.img
	 /dev/sda1 ntfs 100.0M
	 /dev/sda2 ntfs 11.9G
	 /dev/sda device 12.0G

2010-04-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Bugfixes for virt-resize.
	 - copy more than 64 boot loader sectors across, since real boot
	   loaders (eg. for Windows) can be much larger than this
	 - copy bootable flag and ID byte to new partitions
	 - start the first partition on the new disk at the same sector
	   offset as on the old disk
	 - sync the disks before existing

	New partition APIs: part_del, part_get_bootable, part_get/set_mbr_id
	These APIs flesh out further the partitioning API.

	daemon: More reliable parsing of the output from 'parted print'.
	Previously we used strtok.  However this has the problem that
	strtok considers multiple delimiter characters to be like a single
	delimiter, eg. "1:::2" would be parsed the same as "1:2".  In
	other words, the previous code would skip over or fail if there
	are empty fields.

	daemon: Make the RUN_PARTED macro take an error statement.
	This allows us to make the RUN_PARTED macro do something else
	along the error path, other than just returning -1.

	Documentation: Clarify documentation on the bootable flag.

	New API: vgscan
	Implement vgscan to allow for a full rescan of all LVM
	PVs, VGs and LVs.

	New API: ntfsresize.
	This implements the ntfsresize operation, using the external
	program from ntfsprogs.

	virt-make-fs: Use Sys::Guestfs::Lib::feature_available helper function.

2010-04-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Allow aug-ls to take Augeas variable as argument (RHBZ#580016).

2010-04-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove warning "No grub default" (RHBZ#580650).

	If qemu dies during launch in "null vmchannel" mode, don't hang (RHBZ#579155).
	Detect if qemu dies during launch by wait(2)-ing for it, and
	then getting EOF on the qemu pipe.  This was broken in null
	vmchannel mode, causing a hang.

	Don't kill self accidentally.
	Always check that pid > 0 before calling kill (pid, 9).  The
	issue was that sometimes pid == 0, and this ends up killing
	ourselves.

2010-04-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix for "warning: unexpected connection from UID ..."
	This warning is currently a fatal error.  The code attempts
	to retry the accept call, but because we don't reset sock = -1
	the retry doesn't happen and it dies anyway.

	Set sock = -1 so the retry attempt can happen.

2010-04-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API calls to upload/download txz files (RHBZ#580556).

	configure: Default to using Fedora 12 repo (was Fedora 11).
	Fedora 11 is almost EOL at this point.

	Version 1.3.1.

	New tool: virt-make-fs for creating filesystems on devices.

2010-04-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Code cleanups related to RHBZ#580246.
	This includes various code cleanups:

	 (a) A regression test for RHBZ#580246.

	 (b) Use write instead of fwrite to write out the tar file.  This is
	     just because the error handling of write seems to be better
	     specified and easier to use.

	 (c) Use size_t instead of int for length.

	 (d) Clearer debug messages when in verbose mode.

2010-04-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix tar-in command hangs when running out of disk space (RHBZ#580246).
	The problem was this sequence of events:

	 (1) File transfer goes through OK.

	 (2) pclose returns failure (because 'tar' subprocess failed)

	 (3) We try to cancel the transfer by calling cancel_receive.

	Step (3) fails because the transfer (as far as the library is
	concerned) has succeeded, so causing a hang.

	The more fundamental reason why we see steps (1) and (2) is that
	'tar' does NOT fail immediately if there is a write error.  Instead
	it continues reading and discarding the input until the end of the
	input before giving "Error exit delayed from previous errors".
	IMHO this is a bug with tar, since an ENOSPC write error should
	be fatal for tar.

	Check error returns from posix_fallocate (RHBZ#579664).
	posix_fallocate has a non-standard way to return error indications.
	Thus all our calls to posix_fallocate were effectively unchecked.  For
	example:

	  $ guestfish alloc test.img 1P
	  $ echo $?
	  0
	  $ ll test.img
	  -rw-rw-r--. 1 rjones rjones 0 2010-04-06 11:02 test.img
	  $ rm test.img

	With this change, errors are detected and reported properly:

	  $ ./fish/guestfish alloc test.img 1P
	  fallocate: File too large

	virt-df: Match output with native (coreutils) 'df' command (RHBZ#578123).
	This commit fixes the 'Use%' field in the output so it matches what
	coreutils' 'df' command would print.

	Firstly we change the calculation to use the space available to root,
	not the space available to non-root.  This means it matches what 'df'
	when run as root in the guest would show.

	Secondly we display this rounded up to the next whole percent (ie. using
	ceil), which is also what 'df' does.

	Thirdly we change the regression test so it tests this.

	Note that even with these changes you are not guaranteed to get precisely
	the same figures from inside and outside the guest, as it depends on
	how quiescent the guest is and how recently the superblock was synced.

	daemon: Set TERM=dumb inside the daemon.
	Since commit 977edb3185fe8f we have been passing TERM from the
	library into the appliance (for the benefit of virt-rescue).
	However this changes the output of parted, which I would argue
	is a bug in parted:

	 TERM=xterm /sbin/parted -m -- /dev/sda unit b print 2>&1 | hexdump -C
	 00000000  1b 5b 3f 31 30 33 34 68  42 59 54 3b 0a 2f 64 65  |.[?1034hBYT;./de|

	Fix lvresize test on RHEL 5, by fixing guestfs_e2fsck_l.

	Mac OS X: include <rpc/types.h> before <rpc/xdr.h>
	In PortableXDR this is not included automatically so we

	add_drive_ro adds readonly=on option if available.
	Change the add_drive_ro call so it adds the readonly=on option
	if qemu supports that.

	This just means that qemu will not try to open the drive with
	O_RDWR, and should not otherwise change the behaviour of qemu or
	libguestfs.  (In particular, writes to the read-only drive are
	still permitted, and are just discarded when the handle is closed).

	However it should alleviate RHBZ#571714 where udev was deciding
	to incorrectly relabel a device because we had opened the device
	for writing (even though we didn't actually write to it).

2010-03-16  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Allow qemu_supports to run earlier.
	Reimplement qemu_supports() internal function.  Allow it to run
	before launch so we can test qemu features.  Document that you
	should run guestfs_set_qemu as early as possible to make sure
	these tests are reliable.

	Add minimal vim to the appliance for virt-rescue.
	virt-rescue lacks an editor.  Add vim-minimal (Fedora)
	or vim-tiny (Debian) to make up for this omission.

	tests: Don't use <guestfs-internal.h> in tests.
	It was failing when including this header, as a consequence
	of earlier commit 1f56debfcfdc35d6b0.

	guestfs.h: More adjustment to comments in the header file.

	guestfs.h: Move some internal functions to the internal header.
	Functions like guestfs__send were never exported through the public
	API (libguestfs.syms prevented that).  However they appeared in the
	public header.  Move them to the internal header.

	Rearrangement and comment changes in <guestfs.h> header file.
	There should be no substantive change.

2010-03-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Rewrite libguestfs-supermin-helper in C.
	libguestfs-supermin-helper was previously a shell script.  Although
	we had steadily optimized it, there were a number of intractable
	hot spots:

	  (1) cpio still reads input files in 512 byte chunks; this is *very*
	    pessimal behaviour, particularly when SELinux is enabled.
	  (2) the hostfiles globbing was done very inefficiently by the shell,
	    with the shell rereading the same directory over and over again.

	This is a rewrite of this shell script in C.  It is approximately
	3 times faster without SELinux, and has an even greater speed difference
	with SELinux.

	The main features are:

	  (a) It never frees memory, making it simpler.  The program is designed
	    to run and exit in sub-second times, so this is acceptable.
	  (b) It caches directory reads, making the globbing of host files much
	    faster (measured this as ~ 4 x speed up).
	  (c) It doesn't use external cpio, but instead contains code to write
	    newc format cpio files, which is all that the kernel can read.  Unlike
	    cpio, this code uses large buffers for reads and writes.
	  (d) Ignores missing or unreadable hostfiles, whereas cpio gave a
	    warning.
	  (e) Checks all return values from system calls.
	  (f) With --verbose flag, it will print messages timing itself.

	This passes all tests.

	Updated with feedback from Jim Meyering.

	Special case hostfiles handling for libntfs-3g.so
	The ntfs-3g project keeps bumping their soname, and this causes
	dependency problems for the Fedora package.  The root of the problem
	is we depend on /lib/libntfs-3g.so.<N>, but if <N> keeps bumping,
	the dependency keeps breaking.

	This commit changes the hostfiles (and hence dependency) to be on
	/lib/libntfs-3g.so.* instead.  The downside to this is we could end
	up pulling more files into the appliance than are strictly required,
	but it will fix the Fedora packaging problems being felt by the
	Fedora maintainer of ntfs-3g.

	After applying this commit, the change to hostfiles looks like this:

	inspector: Read information about Windows guests from the Registry.
	This commit changes substantially the way that we get information
	about Windows guests.  We now use the Windows Registry to get
	information such as the version, product name and much else.

	This uses Win::Hivex (ie. the hivex library).  'reged' is no longer
	needed or used.

	As an incidental change, this also tries harder to search for
	%systemroot%, in the case when we cannot find boot.ini (ie.
	Windows Vista and more recent).  This ensures we can get more
	detail from those versions of Windows.

2010-03-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	inspector: Add product_name field to output.
	This is a free text string containing the "product name" of

	More complete fix for bash regexp quoting bug.
	Commit 457fccae1b665347 was not a complete fix, in that it
	didn't work properly on RHEL 5 era bash (3.2.x).  For example:

	  file=libntfs-3g.so.74
	  [[ "$file" =~ ^lib(.*)\.so\.([0-9]+)\. ]] && \
	    echo "lib${BASH_REMATCH[1]}.so.${BASH_REMATCH[2]}.*"

	would on those old shells print:

	  libntfs-3g.so.7.*

	It seems the final \. was being treated as a plain period (ie.
	match anything).

	The only way to work around this incompatibility is to assign the
	patterns to variables and match on those, ie:

	  p='^lib(.*)\.so\.([0-9]+)\.'
	  [[ "$file" =~ $p ]] && ...

	This works in both old and new shells.

2010-02-16  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files.

2010-02-16  Rajesh Ranjan  <rranjan@redhat.com>

	Add Hindi translations (RHBZ#565759).

2010-02-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Turn ProtocolLimitWarning into link to documentation section.

	initrd-cat: Needs ProtocolLimitWarning.

	Remove references to FTP, replace with FUSE.
	We originally intended to implement an FTP server (and before
	than, an NFS server).  But we didn't implement either.  We
	did however implement a FUSE service (guestmount) which takes
	the place of both.

	Remove some unused variables.
	Since we have to compile with -Wno-unused-variables, we don't
	spot unused variables in code.  I found these by compiling the
	code in Ubuntu.

	Distribute .gitignore files.
	These are useful for Debian since they keep the tarball unpacked
	in git.

	Add 'make quickcheck' rule to run a quick check.

2010-02-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.0.84.

2010-02-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Don't need to prefix error messages with the command name.
	The RPC stubs already prefix the command name to error messages.
	The daemon doesn't have to do this.  As a (small) benefit this also
	makes the daemon slightly smaller.

	Code in the daemon such as:

	  if (argv[0] == NULL) {
	    reply_with_error ("passed an empty list");
	    return NULL;
	  }

	now results in error messages like this:

	  ><fs> command ""
	  libguestfs: error: command: passed an empty list

	(whereas previously you would have seen ..command: command:..)

2010-02-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Don't prefix error messages with command name.
	The command name is already being added by the RPC stubs, so
	adding it again in Perl and C# just results in doubled error messages
	like:
	  foo: foo: the error

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib::open_guest: Add interface parameter.
	This allows you to override the default QEMU block device emulation.

2010-02-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib::open_guest: Remove freeform parameters.
	Remove the ability to pass freeform parameters to Sys::Virt->new.
	We don't use it, it makes the code more complex to modify, and
	indeed there are no other args that Sys::Virt->new supports so
	this would never be used.

	Also change $readwrite to $rw to match parameter name.

2010-02-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New APIs: add-drive{,-ro}-with-if allows you to set QEMU block emulation.
	The default if=... comes from configure time (currently it
	defaults to if=virtio).

	This change allows you to set the QEMU block emulation.

	We don't think this will be used very often, but virt-v2v
	requires it in order to work around a subtle problem with
	running 'mkinitrd' in an appliance attached to a guest.

2010-02-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: 'interface' is a reserved word in Java.

	add_cdrom: Update docs for adding ISO images.
	See also RHBZ#563450 (NB: This commit does not fix the bug).

2010-02-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use mount-options instead of mount to avoid implicit -o sync.
	guestfs_mount adds -o sync implicitly.  This causes a very large
	performance problem for write-intensive programs (eg. virt-v2v).

	Document this as a "gotcha".

	Change the tests, guestfish, Sys::Guestfs::Lib, guestmount to use
	mount-options instead.

	(Note that this gotcha does not affect mount-ro).

	The source of the performance problem was first identified by
	Matthew Booth.

2010-02-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add -enable-kvm option to qemu command line.
	If the version of qemu being used supports -enable-kvm option,
	then check if /dev/kvm is openable and add this option.

	I have found this option makes no difference, although it is
	*supposed* to enable KVM (hardware virtualization) support.

2010-02-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API call: initrd-cat to list a file from an initrd.

2010-02-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove invalid Plural-Forms header from ml.po.

	Documentation: Added a section on libguestfs gotchas.

	Make virtio block driver be the default for the appliance.
	Previously this caused a serious performance regression,
	but we believe this is now fixed:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=509383

2010-02-08  Ani Peter  <apeter@redhat.com>

	Added Malayalam translations (RHBZ#562710).

2010-02-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Distribute hivexsh.1.html HTML file.

	Update PO files.

2010-02-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	RHEL5: Keep old automake happy by defining docdir

2010-02-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add scripts to EXTRA_DIST.

	Update PO files.

	Prepare for version 1.0.83.

	Add files to EXTRA_DIST.

	hivex: example6: Don't double backslashes.

	hivex: example6: Hypothetical addition of keys for viostor.

	hivex: Fix handling of inline VKs.

	hivexsh: Set correct type for 'expandstring' values.

	hivex: Documentation and cleanups.

	hivex: Make limits into macros.

	hivexsh: Remove unused variable.
	This removes an unused variable left over by
	commit ab608f3948d903af64e814b2e67949a1a71d93a4.

	hivex: Complete the implementation of adding child nodes.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: More debugging around nk 'unknown2' field.

	hivex: Check hash fields in lf/lh records.

	hivexsh: del command: Fix error message.

	hivexsh: lsval: Remove stray quotation mark.

	hivexsh: cd command: fix error handling
	The error behaviour of hivex_node_get_child is subtle, so the 'cd'
	command wouldn't always report errors correctly.  This fixes it.

	hivex: allocate_block should update valid block bitmap.
	The internal allocate_block() function wasn't updating the bitmap,
	so if you revisited a block which you had allocated in the same
	session, you could get an EFAULT error.

	hivex: More debug messages.

	hivex: Documentation update.
	ntreg_lf_record can have id "lf" (old-style hashes) or "lh" (new-
	style hashes).

	hivex: Some missing le32toh endianness conversions.

	hivexsh: Document some peculiarities of the "cd" command.

	hivex: Implement deleting child nodes.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Add flags argument to internal get_children() function.
	When we later call get_children to visit the intermediate
	ri/lf/lh records, we have already deleted the subkey nk-records,
	so checking that those nk-records are still valid is not very
	helpful.

	This commit adds a flag to turn these checks off.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Don't die on valid registries which have bad declared data lengths.
	Some apparently valid registries contain value data length
	declarations which exceed the allocated block size for the
	value.

	Previously the code would return EFAULT for such registries.
	However since these appear to be otherwise valid registries,
	turn this into a warning and just use the allocated block size
	as the data length (in other words, truncate the value).

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Minimal registry example.
	This is the smallest registry you can make and still have it
	load correctly in Windows regedit.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivexsh: Add 'setval' and 'commit' commands.
	This adds the 'setval' and 'commit' commands to the hivex shell.

	Also adds some example scripts showing use of these.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Begin implementation of writing to hives.
	This implements hivex_node_set_values which is used to
	delete the (key, value) pairs at a node and optionally
	replace them with a new set.

	This also implements hivex_commit which is used to commit
	changes to hives back to disk.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Add HIVEX_OPEN_WRITE flag to allow hive to be opened for writing.
	If this flag is omitted (as in the case for all existing callers)
	then the hive is still opened read-only.

	We add a 'writable' flag to the hive handle, and we change the way
	that the hive file (data) is stored.  The data is still mmapped if
	the file is opened read-only, since that is more efficient and allows
	us to handle larger hives.  However if we need to write to the file
	then we have to read it all into memory, since if we had to extend the
	file we need to realloc that data.

	Note the manpage section L</WRITING TO HIVE FILES> comes in a later
	commit.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Tools for analyzing and reverse engineering hive files.
	This commit is not of general interest.  It contains the tools which
	I used to reverse engineer the hive format and to test changes.
	Keeping these with the rest of the code is useful in case in future
	we encounter a hive file that we fail to modify.

	Note that the tools are not compiled by default.  You have to compile
	each explicitly with:

	  make -C hivex/tools <toolname>.opt

	You will also need ocaml-extlib-devel and ocaml-bitstring-devel.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivexsh: Change some exit(1) -> exit(EXIT_FAILURE)

	hivexsh: Only print final \n when interactive.
	When hivexsh was called non-interactively, it would print an
	annoying extra line.  Only print this line if we are being
	used interactively.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivexsh: Change handling of prompt argument to rl_gets()
	Make the result of isatty into a global variable (is_tty).

	Change the rl_gets() function so it takes the prompt string
	instead of a "display prompt?" flag.  rl_gets() then consults
	the global to find out if it should display the prompt at all.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Document that this flag is clear for default keys.

	Misc documentation and gitignore update.

	Move htole*/le*toh macros into a separate header file.
	This allows us to reuse these macros in hivexsh later.

2010-02-04  Sandeep Shedmake  <sshedmak@redhat.com>

	Add Marathi translations (RHBZ#561671).

2010-02-02  Piotr Drąg  <piotrdrag@gmail.com>

	Polish translations (RHBZ#502533).

2010-02-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files.

	Add Gujarti translations (Sweta Kothari) (RHBZ#560918).

2010-02-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update Oriya translations (thanks Manoj Kumar Giri) (RHBZ#559498).

2010-01-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Reimplement hivexget as a simple shell script.
	hivexget is currently a large C program.  Now that we have hivexsh
	(the shell) we can reimplement hivexget as a simple bash script that
	calls out to hivexsh.

	hivex: Add 'hivexsh' program (shell for navigating registry hives).

2010-01-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Set locale in C programs so l10n works (RHBZ#559962).
	This commit adds the calls to setlocale &c to all of the current
	C programs.

	It also adds l10n support to hivexget and hivexml which lacked them
	previously.

	To test this, try:

	LANG=pa_IN.UTF-8 guestfish --cmd-help

	(You can only do this test after installing the package, or at
	least the 'pa.mo' mo-file in the correct place).

2010-01-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Another unreadable file: /var/log/yum.log

	Update PO files.

	Add Tamil translation (RHBZ#559877) (thanks to I.Felix)

	Update Punjabi translation (RHBZ#559480) (thanks Jaswinder Singh)

2010-01-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix regressions/rhbz557655.sh when debugging is enabled (v2).
	The previous fix didn't cope with ordinary warnings emitted by
	qemu (eg. "open /dev/kvm: No such file or directory").  This
	is a hopefully more complete fix for the problem.

	See also commit 3cd7ce75f1ce5048a4d9f6aeaf66aff3194e1096.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix regressions/rhbz557655.sh when debugging is enabled.
	The regression test for RHBZ#557655 would fail if debugging was
	enabled, because debug output would get mixed up with the test
	output.

	To reproduce the error do:

	LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1 make -C regressions TESTS=rhbz557655.sh check

	This commit disables debug for just this test.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement 'vgrename' and 'lvrename' APIs.

	Version 1.0.82.

	hivex: Const-correctness fix on header_checksum (thanks Jim Meyering).

	hivex: Update some previously unknown nk-record fields.
	Update these fields with what we found out from reverse engineering
	the file.  Also bring the unknownX field names into line with
	visualizer.ml.

	hivex: Fix calculation of block size for vk data blocks.

	hivex: Display incorrect block size as unsigned in an error message.

	hivex: display bad block offset in hex

	hivex: hive type in vk-record is an unsigned 32 bit int

	hivex: Add missing le32toh conversion around field access.
	This was missing.  It only worked because we test on a little
	endian platform.

	hivex: Clarify some more fields.
	Taken from sentinelchicken.com documentation.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Modify children/values functions to return intermediate blocks.
	Modify the functions that return child subnodes and values so they
	can also be used to return a list of the intermediate blocks.  This
	is so we can delete those intermediate blocks (in a later commit).

	We also introduce an offset_list structure which is used for collecting
	lists of offsets, ie. lists of nodes, values or blocks.

	Note that this commit should not change the semantics of the code.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Add value_any callback to the visitor.
	The visitor currently contains lots of value_* callbacks, such as
	value_string which is called back when the value has type string.

	This is fine but it makes it complicated to deal with the case where
	you just want to see 'a value', and don't care about its type.

	The value_any callback allows visitors to see values generically.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Move header checksum code into a function.
	This function can be reused later.

	hivex: page 'offset_next' field is really 'page_size'.
	The documentation, as usual, is contradictory.  However this
	field is definitely the page size in all observed registries.
	Furthermore the following field marked 'unknown' is always
	zero, although this contradicts what the sentinelchicken.com
	paper says.

	hivex: Collect more statistics about registries.

	hivex: Store filename in hive handle.

	Added Oriya translations (RHBZ#559498).
	Translation by Manoj Kumar Giri.

	supermin: Add special case for libgcc_s-*.so.N
	Because this file contains the GCC version and a date, it frequently
	changes on the host.  Create a special case so that this file is
	matched using a wildcard for the version/date part of the name.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Added translations for Punjabi (pa-IN) (RHBZ#559480).
	Translated by Jaswinder Singh.

	Also updated pot files.

2010-01-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	supermin: Prevent multilib corruption (RHBZ#558593).
	On some combination of installing, upgrading and removing the base
	libguestfs package on x86_64, multilib can corrupt libguestfs by
	leaving a copy of /usr/bin/libguestfs-supermin-helper around which
	references the wrong architecture (usually, contains links to the
	i386-based appliance, when the x86_64 appliance should be constructed).

	This commit changes libguestfs-supermin-helper so that the script is
	the same on all architectures.  Instead, the library passes the
	differences to the script (eg. $host_cpu).  Because the i386 and
	x86_64 libraries should be at different locations (/usr/lib vs
	/usr/lib64) this should prevent multilib from screwing things up.

	Related links:

2010-01-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Added Telugu translations (RHBZ#559237).
	Also ran 'make -C po update-po' to update the POT file.

2010-01-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	supermin: Ignore more unreadable files found on RHEL 6.

	Sync to latest Gnulib.

2010-01-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Use xstrtol to parse integers (RHBZ#557655).
	Current code uses atoi to parse the generator Int type and
	atoll to parse the generator Int64 type.  The problem with the
	ato* functions is that they don't cope with errors very well,
	and they cannot parse numbers that begin with 0.. or 0x..
	for octal and hexadecimal respectively.

	This replaces the atoi call with a call to Gnulib xstrtol
	and the atoll call with a call to Gnulib xstrtoll.

	The generated code looks like this for all Int arguments:

	  {
	    strtol_error xerr;
	    long r;

	    xerr = xstrtol (argv[0], NULL, 0, &r, "");
	    if (xerr != LONGINT_OK) {
	      fprintf (stderr,
	               _("%s: %s: invalid integer parameter (%s returned %d)\n"),
	               cmd, "memsize", "xstrtol", xerr);
	      return -1;
	    }
	    /* The Int type in the generator is a signed 31 bit int. */
	    if (r < (-(2LL<<30)) || r > ((2LL<<30)-1)) {
	      fprintf (stderr, _("%s: %s: integer out of range\n"), cmd, "memsize");
	      return -1;
	    }
	    /* The check above should ensure this assignment does not overflow. */
	    memsize = r;
	  }

	and like this for all Int64 arguments (note we don't need the
	range check for these):

	  {
	    strtol_error xerr;
	    long long r;

	    xerr = xstrtoll (argv[1], NULL, 0, &r, "");
	    if (xerr != LONGINT_OK) {
	      fprintf (stderr,
	               _("%s: %s: invalid integer parameter (%s returned %d)\n"),
	               cmd, "size", "xstrtoll", xerr);
	      return -1;
	    }
	    size = r;
	  }

	Note this also fixes an unrelated bug in guestfish handling of
	RBufferOut.  We were using 'fwrite' without checking the return
	value, and this could have caused silent failures, eg. in the case
	where there was not enough disk space to store the resulting file,
	or even if the program was interrupted (but continued) during the
	write.

	Replace this with Gnulib 'full-write', and check the return value
	and report errors.

2010-01-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add 'filesize' call.
	Returns the size of a file.  You can already do this with 'stat',
	but this call is good for scripting.

2010-01-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Missing crc kernel module on RHEL 6 / Linux 2.6.32 (fixes RHBZ#557195)

2010-01-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Various improvements in header parsing, thanks to better documentation.

	hivex: Print header fields.  Print all offsets in hex (in debug output).

2010-01-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Send all debug messages to stderr.

	hivex: Remove stray debugging message.

2010-01-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix generation of HTML documentation for website.

	Add guestfs.pod and guestfish.pod to EXTRA_DIST.

	Prepare for version 1.0.81.

	Update to latest Gnulib.

2010-01-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	qemu: Upstream regression of -stdio serial option.
	Best explained by the comment in the code:

	    /* Newer versions of qemu (from around 2009/12) changed the
	     * behaviour of monitors so that an implicit '-monitor stdio' is
	     * assumed if we are in -nographic mode and there is no other
	     * -monitor option.  Only a single stdio device is allowed, so
	     * this broke the '-serial stdio' option.  There is a new flag
	     * called -nodefaults which gets rid of all this default crud, so
	     * let's use that to avoid this and any future surprises.
	     */

	Use linker script to control visibility of symbols.

	generator: Move all library generation code together.

	C#: Add documentation about experimental nature of these bindings.

2010-01-02  Richard Jones  <rich@koneko.local>

	Experimental C# bindings.
	Tested in only limited situations, with Mono on Linux.

2010-01-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update copyright years.

2009-12-31  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Move guestfs(3) and guestfish(1) man pages into subdirectories.
	These manual pages have for a very long time 'lived' in the top
	source directory.

	Clean up this situation by moving those manual pages (plus associated

2009-12-31  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Move src/guestfs-bindtests.c next to other src/ files.

	generator: Use Continuation Passing Style (CPS) in output_to function.
	This makes the code simpler, shorter and less error-prone.

	generator: Rename GPLv2 to GPLv2plus, LGPLv2 to LGPLv2plus.
	The licenses are "any later version", so reflect this in the
	naming of the parameter to generate_header.

	generated code: Set copyright years to 2009-xxxx when current year > 2009.

	Remove separate inspector_generator.ml, combine this with generator.ml.
	This commit combines the previously separate "inspector_generator.ml"
	program which generated bindings for virt-inspector.

	Having two separate programs caused no end of troubles for developers,
	so we now combine them into a single program.

	NOTE: OCaml xml-light is now *required* in order to rebuild the

	appliance: Special case handling for libbfd in the supermin appliance.
	The libbfd library has a constantly changing, non-standard and

	Note that Gnulib nicely avoids explicitly linking with -lpthread
	unless the application program itself links to -lpthread.  Locks

	daemon error handling: Define a new function reply_with_perror_errno.
	This allows you to save the errno from a previous call and
	pass it to reply_with_perror.

	For example, original code:

	  r = some_system_call ();
	  err = errno;
	  do_cleanup ();
	  errno = err;
	  if (r == -1) {
	    reply_with_perror ("failed");
	    return -1;
	  }

	can in future be changed to:

	  r = some_system_call ();
	  err = errno;
	  do_cleanup ();
	  if (r == -1) {
	    reply_with_perror_errno (err, "failed");

	if it's available (on Windows) otherwise falls back to using
	Gnulib fsusage.

	daemon: Move statvfs code into separate file.
	This makes no functional change to the code.  It just moves the

	daemon/statvfs.c.

	daemon: Use gnulib futimens module.
	Instead of checking for futimens support and falling back

	However the gnulib module does not yet support Win32, so
	this change is only really useful on platforms like RHEL 5.

	New tool: virt-list-filesystems
	Use this program as a convenient way to list the filesystems
	available in a disk image or libvirt guest.

	Example:

	  $ virt-list-filesystems /dev/vg_trick/Debian5x64
	  /dev/debian5x64/home
	  /dev/debian5x64/root
	  /dev/debian5x64/tmp
	  /dev/debian5x64/usr
	  /dev/debian5x64/var
	  /dev/sda1

	This is designed to make it easier for novices to use guestfish
	and guestmount.  In particular with guestmount this acts as a way
	to get a list of filesystems to use with the '-m' option.  ie:

	  $ virt-list-filesystems unknowndisk.img
	  /dev/sda1
	  /dev/sda2
	  $ guestmount -a unknowndisk.img -m /dev/sda1 /mnt

	availability: Document how to check for single API calls
	This documents how to use autotools and dlopen(3) to test for
	the availability of single API calls at compile time and run time
	respectively.

	availability: Add a test for this call.
	Because all the tested groups are optional, there's not really
	a group we can reliably test, therefore test against the
	empty list (which should not fail).

	availability: Clarify and fix documentation.

	generator: Passing "" to StringList tests should turn into empty list.
	This is a bug in the generator which wasn't being tickled.  If
	you had a test which expected a StringList or DeviceList parameter,
	and you passed "" to that test, then you'd (probably) expect to be
	testing an empty list, but in fact you got a single element list
	containing an empty string.  This fixes it so you get an empty list.

	build: Ensure building appliance depends on guestfsd
	Previously, only the update.sh rule checked the daemon had been built. update.sh

	availability: Skip tests when functions are not available.

2009-11-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	availability: Add optional groups and implement guestfs_available call.
	The current groups are defined very conservatively using the
	following criteria:
	 (a) Would be impossible to implement on Windows because of
	     sheer architectural differences (eg: mknod).
	 (b) Already optional (augeas, inotify).
	 (c) Not currently optional but not implemented on older RHEL and
	     Debian releases (ntfs-3g.probe, scrub, zerofree).

	The optional groups I've defined according to these criteria are:

	 . augeas
	 . inotify
	 . linuxfsuuid
	 . linuxmodules
	 . linuxxattrs
	 . lvm2
	 . mknod
	 . ntfs3g
	 . scrub
	 . selinux
	 . zerofree

	(Note that these choices don't prevent us from adding more
	optional groups in future.  On the other hand to avoid breaking
	ABIs we would not wish to change the above groups).

	The rest of this large commit is really just implementation:

	Each optional function is classified using Optional "group"
	flag in the generator.

	The daemon has to implement a function

	  int optgroup_<name>_available (void);

	for each optional group.  Some of these functions are fixed at
	compile time, and some do simple run-time tests.

	The do_available implementation in the daemon looks up the correct
	function in a table and runs it.

	We document the optional groups in the guestfs(3) man page.

	Also: I added a NOT_AVAILABLE macro in order to unify all the
	existing places where we had a message equivalent to
	"function __func__ is not available".

2009-11-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	availability: Add guestfs_available.
	Start a new API allowing groups of functions to be tested for
	availability.

	There are two reasons for this:

	(1) If libguestfs is built with missing dependencies (eg. no Augeas lib)
	then the corresponding functions are disabled in the appliance.  Up till
	now there has been no way to test for this except to speculatively
	issue commands and check for errors.

	(2) When we port the daemon to Win32 it is likely that major pieces of
	functionality won't be available (eg. LVM support).  This API gives
	a way to test for that.

	There is no change for existing clients: you still have to check for
	errors from individual API calls.

	For new clients, you will be able to test for availability of particular
	APIs.

	Usage scenario (A): An LVM editing tool which requires
	both the LVM API and inotify in order to function at all:

	  char *apis[] = { "inotify", "lvm2", NULL };
	  r = guestfs_available (g, apis);
	  if (r == -1) {
	    /* print an error and exit */
	  }

	Usage scenario (B): A general purpose tool which optionally provides
	configuration file editing, but this can be disabled, the result
	merely being reduced functionality:

	  char *apis[] = { "augeas", NULL };
	  r = guestfs_available (g, apis);
	  enable_config_edit_menus = r == 0;

	build: Fix parallel build of haskell bindings
	ghc isn't clever enough not to stomp on itself when building dependencies. This

	It also adds a dependency on src/libguestfs.la.

2009-11-19  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	build: Fix inter-directory dependencies
	This change adds an explicit dependency on generator.ml for every file it
	generates, except java files. Java is left for another time because it's
	considerably trickier.

	It also adds a build rule for src/libguestfs.la so it can be rebuilt as required
	from other directories.

	It does this by creating a top level make file, subdir-rules.mk, which can be
	included from sub-directories. sub-directories need to define 'generator_built'
	to include local files which are built by generator.ml, and they will be updated
	automatically.

	This fixes parallel make, and will automatically re-create generated files when
	make is run from any directory.

	It also fixes the problem which efad4f53 was targetting. Specifically,
	src/guestfs_protocol.(c|h) had an erroneous dependency on stamp-generator, and
	therefore generator.ml, despite not being directly created by it. This caused
	them to be recreated every time generator.ml ran rather than only when
	src/guestfs_protocol.x was updated, which cascaded into a daemon and therefore
	appliance update.

	This patch also changes the contents of the distribution tarball by including
	files created by rpcgen.

	generator: Acquire lock to prevent two parallel runs of the generator.
	This commit acquires a lock on a file to prevent two parallel runs of
	the generator from stomping on each other.  The second run will wait
	for the first to complete before starting.

	The lock is acquired on the "HACKING" file because it's convenient --
	we are already checking this file exists to make sure that we don't
	start off in the wrong directory.

	Tested by adding some artificial sleeps in the code to observe
	locking behaviour between two parallel runs.

	generator: Fix API of functions that return RBufferOut
	(NB: The API / ABI doesn't actually change here - it's just made much
	simpler to use).

	The API for RBufferOut functions was unexpectedly hard to use in the
	case where a zero-length buffer might be returned.  For discussion on
	this see:

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2009-November/thread.html#00115

	This commit ensures that in the zero-length buffer case, the return
	value is never NULL.  Thus code is now able to just check if the return
	value == NULL to indicate an error, which is simpler for all concerned.

	The implementation of this is, however, more complex because we have
	to be careful about this case inside both the daemon and the library
	code, which is what this commit does.

	This has passed a full round of tests.

	fuse: Add tests for guestmount.
	This script contains non-exhaustive tests for the system calls
	implemented by guestmount.

	New API call: fill - fill a file with octets

	fuse: Fix cache invalidation in rename operation.
	We need to invalidate both parameters, otherwise the old (moved)
	file can appear that it still exists after the move.

	fuse: Fix hard link creation.
	The parameters were swapped.  We also need to invalidate the
	cache for both parameters.

	fuse: Fix symlink creation (RHBZ#538069).
	The parameters were swapped, preventing symlinks from being created.

	virt-df: Ignore domains which have ID 0.
	This is the remainder of the fix for RHBZ#538041.  Domains
	which have ID 0 are special domains.  libvirt defines it as
	the "control plane OS".  Only Xen and HyperV have this
	behaviour, and in both cases we should ignore those domains
	for the purposes of virt-df (user can just run "df" if they
	need that information for the dom0).

	virt-df: Turn errors into warnings when listing all domains.
	This is a partial fix for RHBZ#538041.  When listing all domains,
	don't die just because one domain fails, but keep trying for the
	rest.

	use it to measure the time since guestfs_launch was called
	so that we can start profiling guest launch.

2009-11-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generic partition creation interface.
	This commit introduces a generic partition creation interface
	which should be future-proof and extensible, and partially
	replaces the old sfdisk-based interface.

	The implementation is based on parted but is hopefully not too
	dependent on the particulars of parted.

	The following new calls are introduced:

	  guestfs_part_init:
	    Initialize a disk with a partition table.  Unlike the sfdisk-
	    based interface, we also support GPT and other partition
	    types, which is essential to scale to devices larger than 2TB.

	  guestfs_part_add: Add a partition to an existing disk.

	  guestfs_part_disk:
	    Convenience function which combines part_init & part_add,
	    creating a single partition that covers the whole disk.

	  guestfs_part_set_bootable:
	  guestfs_part_set_name:
	    Set various aspects of existing partitions.

	  guestfs_part_list:
	    List partitions on a device.  This returns a programming-friendly
	    list of partition structs (in contrast to sfdisk-l which cannot
	    be parsed).

	  guestfs_part_get_parttype:
	    Return the partition table type, eg. "msdos" or "gpt".

	The following calls are planned, but not added currently:

	  guestfs_part_get_bootable
	  guestfs_part_get_name
	  guestfs_part_set_type
	  guestfs_part_get_type

	daemon: Always reflect command stderr to stderr when debugging.
	When debugging (ie. LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1 & verbose flag set in daemon)
	always reflect any stderr output from commands that we run to
	stderr of the daemon, so it is visible.

	Previously if stderror == NULL in command*, stderr output was
	just eaten and discarded which meant useful error messages could
	be lost.

2009-11-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Add flags argument to command*() functions.
	This adds new variations of the command*() functions which
	take a 'flags' argument.  Currently the only flag available
	is defined as follows:

	 COMMAND_FLAG_FOLD_STDOUT_ON_STDERR: For broken external commands
	 that send error messages to stdout (hello, parted) but that don't
	 have any useful stdout information, use this flag to capture the
	 error messages in the *stderror buffer.  If using this flag,
	 you should pass stdoutput as NULL because nothing could ever be
	 captured in that buffer.

	This patch also adds some documentation for command*()
	function.

	fish: New command 'sparse', like 'alloc' but to generate sparse files.
	With sparse you can make sparse files, which is fun because you

	Debian: Use /bin/bash as the shell for regression test scripts.
	/bin/sh on Debian is a minimal shell called 'dash' which doesn't
	support some features we need such as the particular 'function'

	Previously when we ran external commands from the daemon, stdin

	FUSE filesystem support.
	This implements FUSE filesystem support so that any libguestfs-
	accessible disk image can be mounted as a local filesystem.

	Note: file writes (ie. write(2) system call) is not yet implemented.

	The API needs more test coverage, particularly lesser-used system
	calls.

	The big unresolved issue is UID/GID mapping between guest filesystem
	IDs and the host.  It's not easy to automate this because you need
	extra details about the guest itself in order to get to its
	UID->username map (eg. /etc/passwd from the guest).

	Allow callers to disable the recovery process.

2009-11-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API call: pread
	guestfs_pread lets you do partial file reads from arbitrary
	places within a file.  It works like the pread(2) system call.

	New API calls: lstatlist, lxattrlist, readlinklist.
	These three functions are very specifically designed for FUSE
	support, so we can list directories efficiently.  Instead of
	making lots of lstat, lgetxattr and readlink calls, we can make just
	three calls per directory to grab all the attributes (which we
	then cache briefly).

2009-11-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API calls: truncate, truncate_size, mkdir_mode, utimens, lchown.
	truncate, truncate_size: Used to truncate files to a particular
	size, or to zero bytes.

	mkdir_mode: Like mkdir but allows you to also specify the
	initial permissions for the new directory.

	utimens: Set timestamp on a file with nanosecond accuracy.

	lchown: Corresponding to lchown(2) syscall (we already have chown).

	The implementation is complicated by the fact that we had to
	add an Int64 parameter type to the generator.

	appliance: Don't rebuild the appliance every time configure runs.
	config.status touches make.sh each time it runs, even if the

	Fix rstructs_used handling in guestfish generated code.
	rstructs_used wasn't correctly generating code for guestfish
	because guestfish doesn't make all functions visible.  Since the
	calculation of rstructs_used was over all functions (including
	ones not available in guestfish) it could have generated
	unnecessary functions.

2009-10-26  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: case-sensitive-path to return case sensitive path on NTFS 3g fs
	This function handles an annoyance/peculiarity of the Linux
	NTFS 3g driver, which is that it exports NTFS filesystems with
	names case sensitive, even though under Windows they would be
	case insensitive.

	This causes problems because the location of (eg.) c:\windows
	might appear as /windows or /WINDOWS (etc) depending on the
	inconsequential details of how it was originally created.

	Example of this problem on a real Windows guest:

	  ><fs> file /windows/system32/config/system.log
	  libguestfs: error: file: access: /windows/system32/config/system.log: No such file or directory
	  ><fs> case-sensitive-path /windows/system32/config/system.log

	find0 is more scalable than find.  virt-ls will no longer
	crash if asked to recursively list / on a Linux guest.

2009-10-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: find0 (unlimited version of find)
	This adds a new API call guestfs_find0, which is like guestfs_find
	but mainly doesn't suffer from the protocol limit of the earlier
	command.  The earlier command is not deprecated because it is
	still very useful.

	guestfs_find0 uses a FileOut parameter and writes the results to
	an external file.  The filenames in the output are separated by
	ASCII NUL characters (so a bit like "find -print0").

	There is also the addition of a regression test for this command.

2009-10-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfs_find: Document protocol limits for this API call.
	guestfs_find has to send the complete list of files in a single
	protocol message (hence, limited to 2-4 MB).  Unfortunately on
	a typical Linux guest, guestfs_find ("/") will exceed this limit
	resulting in an error.

	Therefore we should add an unlimited version of this call in a
	future commit.  This commit just documents the current limit.

2009-10-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New tool: virt-ls
	This tool makes available the functionality of "ls", "ll", and "find"
	in a slightly simpler to use form.

	New tool: virt-tar
	This adds a new tool call virt-tar which is a general purpose
	archive and uploading tool.  It doesn't add any functionality
	which wasn't previously possible using guestfish, but makes it
	simpler to access for some users.

	Examples:

	 virt-tar -zx myguest /home home.tar.gz
	 virt-tar -zu myguest uploadstuff.tar.gz /tmp

	tools: Make warnings about running on live guests more prominent.
	Add prominent warnings to the man pages about how it is dangerous
	to run these tools against live guests.

2009-10-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Move virt tools (virt-cat, virt-edit etc) into tools/ subdirectory.
	This moves the tool programs into a single directory:
	  cat/* -> tools/virt-cat
	  df/* -> tools/virt-df
	  edit/* -> tools/virt-edit
	  rescue/* -> tools/virt-rescue

	This in itself simplifies the build process because we only need
	one Makefile and one copy of 'run-locally'.

	'run-*-locally' has become just 'run-locally' and takes an extra
	parameter which is the name of the tool, eg:
	  run-locally cat [virt-cat params...]

	virt-inspector stays in its own directory, because this contains
	more than just a single Perl script.

	inspector: Generate language bindings for OCaml.
	This commit adds a generic mechanism for deriving language bindings
	for virt-inspector, and implements one concrete binding, for OCaml.

	The bindings are generated from the RELAX NG schema (virt-inspector.rng)
	which is supposed to be a correct and always up to date description
	of the XML that the virt-inspector program can generate.

	From the RNG we generate a set of types to describe the output of
	virt-inspector for the language, plus an XML parser, plus some
	glue code to actually run an external instance of virt-inspector
	and parse the resulting XML.

	At runtime, an external 'virt-inspector --xml <name>' command runs
	and the XML is parsed into language-specific structures.

	This has been tested on the four example files (inspector/example?.xml)

	The only particular difficulty about the OCaml binding is the use of
	Obj.magic, which is naughty but works because of the isomorphism
	between the representation of tuples and records in OCaml.  This
	seems to cause no problems in my test program.  Apart from this, the
	OCaml binding is straightforward and could be adapted easily for any
	other languages that want type-safe virt-inspector bindings.

	It's important to keep virt-inspector.rng up to date with changes
	to virt-inspector's XML output format.

	New tool: virt-edit
	Edit any file in a guest.  This was possibly previously
	using guestfish, but having a separate command makes it

	Add 'virt-rescue' command.
	This command runs a "rescue appliance" against a virtual machine

	  Welcome to virt-rescue, the libguestfs rescue shell.

	  Note: The contents of / are the rescue appliance.
	  You have to mount the guest's partitions under /sysroot
	  before you will be able to examine them.

	Add direct appliance mode flag and implementation.
	When the g->direct flag is set, the appliance stdin/stdout
	are not connected to the library.  Instead they inherit the
	stdin/stdout of the caller.

	This is used to implement virt-rescue.

2009-09-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Tidy up appliance rescue code.
	The appliance shouldn't run the daemon after we leave the
	rescue shell.  It should just exit instead.

2009-09-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Rejig configure.ac tests for qemu vmchannel support.
	vmchannel is no longer required, so we shouldn't test for it.
	However we should test instead for user mode networking support.

	Also fix up the documentation / error messages.

	Always test for vmchannel and user mode networking support in
	qemu.  This gives us more troubleshooting information if people
	report bugs.

2009-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Prepare for 1.0.71.
	Update version number and update PO files.

	Change handling of spaces on Linux kernel command line.

	Update documentation of qemu / vmchannel.

2009-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Implement "null vmchannel" - no vmchannel needed!
	This commit removes the requirement for vmchannel, although retaining
	support for it.

	In this configuration, known as "null vmchannel", the library
	listens on a random loopback port.  It passes the number of this
	port to the appliance (guestfs_vmchannel=tcp:10.0.2.2:12345), and
	the daemon then connects back.  The library, instead of connecting,
	listens and accepts the connection during guestfs_launch.

	QEMU SLIRP (user mode networking) is still required to make this
	work: SLIRP forwards the TCP connection transparently (instead of
	explicitly as with guestfwd) to 127.0.0.1:<port>

	There is a window in which any other local process on the machine
	could see the port number in the qemu command line and try to
	connect to it.  This would be a devastating security hole, because
	any local process could pretend to be the daemon and feed back
	malicious replies to our remote procedure calls.  To prevent this,
	we check the UID of the other side of the TCP connection.  If
	the UID is different from the library's EUID, then we reject the
	connection.  To do this we have to parse /proc/net/tcp.  (On Solaris
	we could use getsockopt (SO_PEERCRED), but this doesn't work on
	Linux TCP sockets).

	Other vmchannel(s) are still supported.  This is important, because
	we can't in general be sure the qemu will always support SLIRP.
	In particular, in recent versions of qemu it is possible to compile
	out SLIRP.

2009-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Gnulib: Add arpa-inet and netinet-in modules.

2009-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Flexible guestfs_vmchannel parameter for future appliances.
	This reimplements parts of commit da0a4f8d1f6ddd302ceba028d87c6e009589e503
	in a different, but compatible way.

	We pass guestfs_vmchannel=tcp:<ip>:<port> on the command line.  This
	is intended to be used as follows (now and in future versions):

	  tcp:10.0.2.4:6666    for guestfwd vmchannel
	  tcp:10.0.2.2:<port>  for future "no vmchannel" implementation
	  /dev/vcon4           for future virtio-console vmchannel*

	It also accepts the old-style guestfs=10.0.2.4:6666 parameter which
	is sent by older libraries, and turns this transparently into the
	correct format above.

	If no guestfs_vmchannel is passed, then this defaults to the guestfwd
	vmchannel which older libraries would expect.

	* Maybe this last one should be dev:/dev/vcon4 or file:/dev/vcon4, but
	we don't need to decide that now.

2009-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Rearrange and tidy up code in guestfsd.c
	This just tidies up the main() function in the daemon.  There is
	no longer a huge fixed-sized buffer used for the kernel command
	line.  Variables are moved closer to where they are used.  Some
	local variables turned out to be unused - these are removed.  Finally
	the part that reads the kernel command line is moved into a separate
	function.

	There is only minimal functional change here (it now prints out
	the kernel command line).

	Literal '4' replaced with 'sizeof' expression, at Jim Meyering's
	suggestion during patch review.

2009-09-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Make GUESTFWD_PORT into a string.

	Remove unnecessary extra space from qemu command line.

2009-09-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Remove guestfs_wait_ready (turn it into a no-op).
	This commit changes guestfs_launch so that it both launches
	the appliance and waits until it is ready (ie. the daemon communicates
	back to us).

	Since we removed the pretence that we could implement a low-level
	asynchronous API, the need to call launch() followed by wait_ready()
	has looked a bit silly.

	Now guestfs_wait_ready() is basically a no-op.  It is left in the
	API for backwards compatibility.  Any calls to guestfs_wait_ready()
	can be removed from client code.

2009-09-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Combine temporary buffers.
	buf[], append[] and memsize_str[] were all temporary buffers
	used in non-overlapping code.

	Combine them to use a single buffer (buf[]).

2009-09-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Rearrange qemu command line order (no functional change).

2009-09-18  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Enable new-style -chardev ... guestfwd command line.
	Newer versions of qemu have changed the command line format
	(again).  '-net channel' is now deprecated.  Instead we use:

	    -chardev socket,id=guestfsvmc,path=/path/to/sock,server,nowait
	    -net user,vlan=0,net=10.0.2.0/8,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.4:6666-chardev:guestfsvmc
	    -net nic,model=ne2k_pci,vlan=0

	The old style format is still used if the new style is not
	detected at runtime.

2009-09-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix code which looked for leaked FDs between each command.
	This code was not checking the return value from system()
	so it failed if uncommented.  Add ignore_value() around the
	call to system.  However, leave the code still disabled.

2009-09-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Remove explicit guestfs=10.0.2.4:6666 kernel command line parameter.
	Since we control the appliance tightly, we can just specify
	that it will always use a particular host and port, and we
	don't need to pass it on the command line each time.

	Also the VMCHANNEL_* constants are only relevant to the
	particular guestfwd vmchannel implementation, so we rename
	them as GUESTFWD_*.

2009-09-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Daemon: fix handling of errors from xread and xwrite.
	If xread or xwrite returns -1, that indicates an error and we
	should exit.  Note that xread/xwrite has already printed the
	error message.

2009-09-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix verbose packet dumping functions.
	Add the configure parameter --enable-packet-dump so that this
	code can be enabled without editing the source.

	This code is normally commented out, because it is too verbose
	unless you happen to be debugging the underlying protocol.  Because
	it is normally commented out, I found it had bit-rotted slightly.
	This commit also fixes the obvious problems.

2009-09-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	'len' should be an unsigned 32 bit int.
	This only happened to work by accident before because 'unsigned len'
	happens to be 32 bit on all platforms we support.

	Disable -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations
	This warning indicates that GCC could not do a particular sort
	of loop optimization.  It pops up randomly in certain forms of
	looping code, and seems safe to ignore.

2009-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update PO files (no functional change).

	Prepare for version 1.0.70.

	Update PO files.

2009-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Set minimum gettext version to 0.17.
	This fixes the problem that the 1.0.69 tarball would fail in
	the po/ subdirectory when installing:

	make[1]: Entering directory `/builddir/build/BUILD/libguestfs-1.0.69/po'
	/bin/sh @MKINSTALLDIRS@ /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/libguestfs-1.0.69-1.fc11.x86_64/usr/share
	/bin/sh: @MKINSTALLDIRS@: No such file or directory
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/builddir/build/BUILD/libguestfs-1.0.69/po'

	RHEL 5.3 has gettext 0.14.6.  However the tarball will still
	build (since it includes all the required code).  This may cause
	a problem if RHEL users want to build from the git repository.

2009-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Fix comparison between signed and unsigned (for RHEL 5).

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Move decl out for C99 compliance.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update PO files.

	Move guestfs-internal-actions.h to EXTRA_DIST.

	Prepare for 1.0.69.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Remove main loop.
	This commit removes the external main loop, which never worked
	and caused a number of bugs.  Requests are now done synchronously,
	and if the user wants to have requests issued in the background
	or to have a responsive GUI, then they'll just have to use threads.

	The big change is to push all reads and writes through two
	functions called send_to_daemon (for writes) and recv_from_daemon
	(for reads) which operate synchronously.  These functions
	read/write whole messages, and also handle checking for EOF
	(ie. daemon died) and asynchronous log message events from
	qemu (eg. from debug / dmesg printed by the guest).  A more
	complete description of how these work can be found in the code.

	This code passes a complete run of the tests.

	Bugs believed to be fixed by this commit:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=501888
	  internal error: reply callback called twice

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=504418
	  In virt-inspector: "download: guestfs_download reply failed, see earlier error messages"

	I have tried to avoid reintroducing this:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=508713
	  libguestfs: error: write: Broken pipe (guestfish only)

	One other benefit of this is that 'set_busy/end_busy' calls
	no longer appear in traces.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Don't enable trace in set_trace test.
	This leaves trace enabled afterwards, resulting in some
	ugly test messages.

	Fix type punning warning about use of CMSG_DATA in Rawhide.

2009-09-14  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Enable grouping in string lists
	This change adds the ability to group entries in a string list with single
	quotes. So the string:
	  "'foo bar'"
	becomes 1 token rather than 2. Consequently single quotes must now be escaped:
	  "\'"
	resolves to a literal single quote.

	Incidentally, this change also alters another, probably unintentional behaviour
	of the previous implementation, in that tokens are separated by any amount of
	whitespace rather than a single whitespace character. I.e.:
	  "a  b"
	resolves to:
	  'a' 'b'
	rather than:
	  'a' '' 'b'
	That last syntax can be used if an empty argument is still desired. Whitespace
	is now also defined to include tabs.

	parse_string_list can also now fail if it contains an unmatched open quote.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Ignore localrepo/ directory.
	This can be used by people building from source and packagers for
	their own purposes.

	Add command trace functionality.
	Enable this by calling guestfs_trace (handle, 1) or by
	setting the LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1 environment variable.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Non-daemon actions indirect through generated code.
	Previously non-daemon actions were called directly by
	user code, eg:

	/* Non-generated */
	int
	guestfs_set_verbose (guestfs_h *g, int v)
	{
	  g->verbose = !!v;
	  return 0;
	}

	This changes these actions so they go indirectly via
	some generated code, eg:

	/* Generated */
	int guestfs_set_verbose (guestfs_h *g,
			int verbose)
	{
	  return guestfs__set_verbose (g, verbose);
	}

	/* Non-generated */
	int
	guestfs__set_verbose (guestfs_h *g, int v)
	{
	  g->verbose = !!v;
	  return 0;
	}

	The aim is to have a place in the generated code where
	we can add debug or tracing information for these non-
	daemon calls.

2009-09-14  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Redirect stdout when executing remote commands
	guestfish --listen necessarily redirects its stdout to /dev/null so as not to
	interfere with eval. The remote protocol doesn't contain any other provision for
	collecting stdout for the caller, so executing guestfish --remote will never
	generate any output.

	This patch fixes that by forwarding the caller's STDOUT to the listener over the
	unix socket connection. The listener redirects its STDOUT to the caller's STDOUT
	for the duration of the command, then closes it again.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	avoid build-from-scratch failure due to missing daemon/configure
	* bootstrap: Don't use autoreconf's --norecursive

	anywhere else.  Handle the >5-argument case, too, for these:
	ocaml_guestfs_test0_byte, ocaml_guestfs_sfdisk_byte,
	ocaml_guestfs_sfdisk_N_byte.

2009-08-27  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* bootstrap: Tell gnulib-tool to put .m4 files in m4/, not gnulib/m4.
	* autogen.sh: Move autoreconf from here into...
	* bootstrap: ...here, so that it is run only when gnulib-tool is.
	Also, tell it to skip the usual autopoint and libtoolize runs.
	* m4/.gitignore: Update.

	build: invoke autopoint with --force
	* bootstrap: Invoke autopoint with --force, to avoid warning
	about existing build-aux/config.rpath.

	* src/guestfs.c (_GNU_SOURCE): Likewise.
	* bootstrap (modules): Add asprintf, strchrnul, strerror, strndup

	functions like getopt_long that use argv[0] use the clean name.

	guestfish: diagnose stdout write failure
	Use gnulib's closeout module to ensure any failure to write to
	stdout is detected and reported.
	* fish/fish.c: Include "closeout.h".
	(main): Call atexit (close_stdout);
	* bootstrap (modules): Add closeout.

	guestfish: don't try to diagnose getopt failure
	* fish/fish.c: ... getopt_long already does that.  Instead, suggest
	"Try `guestfish --help' for more information."

	guestfish: write --help to stdout, use gnulib's progname module
	* fish/fish.c: Include "progname.h".
	(main): Call set_program_name to initialize.
	Don't hard-code guestfish everywhere.  Use program_name.
	However, be careful when modifying argv[0], since it is used
	in the hopes that it is an absolute file name.
	(usage): Don't spew all of --help for a mis-typed option.
	Split long lines.

	build: avoid some autoconf warnings
	* configure.ac: Move gl_EARLY and gl_INIT to be earlier.

	Cleanup initialisation of hash entries in Lib.pm

2009-08-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@debian5x64.home.annexia.org>

	tests: Use ISO instead of squashfs.
	The squashfs format changes too much.  Use an ISO file for
	the tests instead.

2009-08-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	mke2fs: Use e4fsprogs programs if available.
	On RHEL 5, mke2fs is ancient, and there is a non-standard "mke4fs"
	binary which acts like the more recent mke2fs on Fedora.  Since there
	are several annoyances and actual bugs in the ancient RHEL 5 mke2fs,
	use mke4fs instead if it's available.

	tests: modprobe fat instead of ext2 module.
	On RHEL 5, ext2 is compiled into the kernel, so trying to modprobe
	it will fail.  I've checked that fat.ko is always a module on the
	platforms we care about (RHEL 5, Fedora 11, Debian), so use that
	to test instead.

2009-08-19  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tests: Conditionally skip UUID tests.
	More tests introduced which break with old e2fsprogs that didn't
	support UUIDs.  Skip those tests when the old platform is
	detected.

	Also tidy up this code a little.

	Don't assume grub is on a separate boot filesystem
	Paths in grub.conf are relative to the filesystem containing it. grub parsing
	currently assumes that it is on /boot, and will fail if it isn't, for example
	because a guest only has a single partition.

	This patch makes grub parsing work harder to work out what grub paths are
	relative to. Firstly, it looks for a previous detected 'linux-grub' filesystem.
	If this isn't found, it tries to work out which filesystem contains
	/boot/grub/menu.lst and uses that.

2009-08-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	add_drive: Don't use cache=off if not supported by underlying filesystem.
	If you use the guestfs_add_drive function, then currently it
	generates a qemu command line element like:

	  -drive ...,cache=off,...

	This causes qemu to try to open the device with O_DIRECT.
	Unfortunately some filesystems don't support this flag, notably tmpfs,
	which means you can't use libguestfs in conjunction with tmpfs.  On
	some systems /tmp is a tmpfs filesystem.

	This patch fixes this so that if the filesystem doesn't support
	O_DIRECT, then we omit the cache=off parameter.  This seems reasonable
	from a reliability point of view, because if you're using tmpfs then
	you probably didn't expect reliability in the case where your system
	suddenly powers off.

	Add 'setcon', 'getcon' commands to set and get the SELinux context.

2009-08-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Return error if allocations fail.

	Add documentation for SELinux configuration.
	Also use L</...> to link between sections.

	Spelling fix: labelled -> labeled.

	If using SELinux, mount /selinux in the appliance.
	If selinux=1 on the Linux kernel command line, then we mount
	/selinux in the appliance.  We will also bind-mount this
	directory into guests when we run commands.

	Allow selinux=? kernel flag to be controlled.
	Adds new API calls to set and get this flags.

	Avoid "comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions"

	daemon/file.c: remove duplicate absolute-path check
	* daemon/file.c (do_file): Remove redundant use of ABS_PATH.
	It's redundant because the preceding line invokes NEED_ROOT_OR_IS_DEVICE,

2009-08-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Tests: swapon_device test mkswap /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sdb.
	On RHEL 5, mkswap /dev/sdb fails, even with the '-f' option
	(contradictory to what the manual page says).

	This commit adds a new 'InitPartition' initialization which
	just creates /dev/sda1, and then does the swap test on that.

2009-08-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Always pass mkswap -f parameter.
	Otherwise mkswap will give a silly error if you ask it to
	swap on a whole device.

	Tests: Don't test block size in statvfs test.

	Cleanup whitespace warnings in Lib.pm

2009-08-03  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Use grub entries to find Linux kernels
	This change adds grub parsing to Lib.pm. It adds the following structure to $os:
	  {boot}
	  ->{configs}
	    ->[0]
	      ->{title}   = "Fedora (2.6.29.6-213.fc11.i686.PAE)"
	      ->{kernel}  = \kernel
	      ->{cmdline} = "ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_mbooth-lv_root rhgb"
	      ->{initrd}  = \initrd
	  ->{default} = 0

	The kernel and initrd entries are just references to their top level entries
	under kernels and initrd_modules respectively.

	It also changes the way Linux kernels and initrd are discovered. Instead of
	searching /lib/modules and /boot for files with matching names, kernels and
	initrds are scanned as they are discovered in grub.conf.

	Additionally, the following attributes are added to the kernels top level entry:
	* path
	    The path to the kernel's vmlinuz file.
	* package
	    The name of the package which installed the kernel.

	The xml output of virt-inspector is updated to reflect all of the above changes.

	up the security.selinux extended attributes on files in a
	not-very-useful way.

	We can't enable SELinux because we don't know what policy

	These commands can be used to make hard and symbolic links.  The
	readlink command is used to read existing symbolic links.

	build: fix test for --nocompress option
	The test for febootstrap-to-initramfs' --nocompress option
	was always failing for me on F11.  Here's why:

	  $ bash                               ~/w/co/libguestfs:210-comment-fix
	  $ t=`febootstrap-to-initramfs 2>&1`
	  [Exit 1]
	  $ if ! echo $t|grep -sq -- --nocompress; then echo not found; fi
	  not found

	Notice: without quotes, the [--nocompress] term expands to "k",
	because I happen to have a temporary file named "k":

	  $ echo $t
	  Usage: febootstrap-to-initramfs [--files=filelist] k DIR Please read
	  febootstrap-to-initramfs(8) man page for more information.
	  $ echo "$t"
	  Usage: febootstrap-to-initramfs [--files=filelist] [--nocompress] DIR
	  Please read febootstrap-to-initramfs(8) man page for more information.

	a simpler example gives a clue:

	  $ touch a b c
	  $ echo [--z]
	  a b c
	  $ echo [--a]
	  a
	  $ echo [--b]
	  a b

	it's interpreting [--nocompress] as a range: "-" through "n", plus
	the other characters, ocmpres.  "k" falls in the --n range.

	Anyhow, here's the fix:

	Subject: [PATCH] build: fix test for --nocompress option

	* configure.ac: Fix underquoting bug that would cause the test
	for febootstrap-to-initramfs' --nocompress option always to fail
	with certain-letter-named files in the top directory.

2009-07-30  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	fix comments; move declarations
	* daemon/devsparts.c (do_list_devices, do_list_partitions):
	Remove stray words in comments.
	Move declarations down to definition.

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Whitespace and comment changes.

	df: Fix alignment of columns.

	guestfish: Make more strings translatable.
	However this doesn't yet attempt to translate the POD
	command documentation.  We need a plan to do that.

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	tests: Use squashfs for static data where possible.
	Instead of creating a new InitBasicFS for just about every test,
	where a test doesn't need to write to the filesystem it is far
	faster to use prepared data on an InitSquashFS instead.

	This commit changes as many tests as possible to make this so,
	making the tests much faster.

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	tests: Fix read_file test.
	The test ignored the fact that this function returns a (char *, size_t)
	pair, and just treated the char * as a string.  This of course would
	fail if the string didn't happen to be nul-terminated.

	The tests are updated to add a new TestOutputBuffer type which should
	be used with functions that return RBufferOut.

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Implement '*grep*' family of commands.

	Updated Polish translations (Piotr Drąg).

	Version 1.0.65.

	Updated PO files.

	build: avoid locale-specific changes in generated, VC'd file
	When I build with LC_ALL=C in my environment,
	the all-local rule generates po/POTFILES.in that
	is sorted differently from the on that is checked in:

	rule as well as to reflect the change in the generated file:

	On RHEL 5, 'file' command prints 'AMD x86-64' for 'x86-64' arch.

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Run cpio with --quiet option so it doesn't print 'xx blocks'

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Lib.pm: Skip tests if perl-libintl module is not available.

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Lib.pm: Use Perl backtick instead of slurp (Aron Griffis).

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Don't show empty CD devices (RHBZ#514505).

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	ocaml: Rebuild the tests from source if the main library changes.

	inspector: Determine guest architecture.
	This commit adds kernel and userspace architecture detection
	(fully for Linux, partially for Windows).  It adds an architecture
	for each kernel detected, and an architecture for each root (ie.
	userspace) found.

	Lib.pm: Add file_architecture command.
	This command detects the architecture of some types of binaries,
	libraries, kernel modules and initrd images.

	Lib: Document the $ro parameter for mount_operating_system properly.

	Mention related tools in the manual page.

2009-07-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Whitespace: indent some names in images/Makefile.am correctly.

	Lib.pm: Use 'file' as replacement for 'zfile'.

	Pass '-z' parameter to 'file' command so it looks inside compressed files.
	Also we deprecate the old 'zfile' command.

	Add DeprecatedBy flag to mark functions which are deprecated.

	Need to declare asprintf_nowarn as inline to avoid gcc complaining.

2009-07-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Replace shell_quote function with %Q and %R printf specifiers.
	%Q => simple shell quoted string
	%R => path will be prefixed by /sysroot

	eg. snprintf (cmd, sizeof cmd, "cat %R", path); system (cmd);

2009-07-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add InitSquashFS test type, for tests that just use the squashfs (/dev/sdd).
	This also speeds up those tests because we don't have to wait
	to create a filesystem which is never used.

2009-07-24  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make read-only optional in mount_operating_system()

2009-07-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	More ideas on a quick Perl one-liner syntax for TODO file.

	guestfish -iv should print virt-inspector command (for debugging).

	Reformat the TODO file.

2009-07-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Pass cgroup_disable=memory, saves ~ 5MB of RAM.

2009-07-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	get_append call can return NULL, but bindings didn't handle it.
	It's not a good idea because there is no way to return an error
	indication.  However at least this means it won't segfault.

	RHEL 5 thinks squashfs is HFS+ filesystem, unless we specify the type explicitly.

	Remove hard-coded qemu-kvm, replace with $QEMU.

	Version 1.0.63

2009-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add libguestfs-test-tool.
	This is an end-user testing tool, designed to test basic functionality
	of libguestfs/qemu/kernel combination on the end-user's final host
	machine.

	It does not perform a thorough test, but should be enough to find
	most booting issues.

	Also this is intended to be used when reporting bugs.

2009-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix typo in error message.

	Revert "Add 'set-kernel'/'get-kernel'/LIBGUESTFS_KERNEL to override appliance kernel."
	This reverts commit 34d2df41626f1ee4172a6d40b06d72d6ed9d6348.

	set-append and set-kernel parameters are both nullable.
	(So are the return values, but leave that bug for another day).

	Add 'set-kernel'/'get-kernel'/LIBGUESTFS_KERNEL to override appliance kernel.
	This allows you to override the appliance kernel with an easy
	command or environment variable.

	Todo: Suggestion for 'replace' command.

2009-07-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add commented-out support for alternate guestfwd syntax.
	This commit just moves code around.  The new support is not enabled
	because it doesn't work.  See qemu-devel, subject
	"guestfwd option doesn't allow supplementary ,server,nowait"

	configure: Detect new-style guestfwd support (RHBZ#512957)
	However new qemu 0.10.5 still doesn't work.

	Library: Pass more options on the Linux kernel command line.
	Always pass:
	  noapic             (APIC causes problems for lots of people)
	  udevtimeout=300    (for very slow qemu using softemu)
	  acpi=off           (ACPI is troublesome and unnecessary, so turn it off)

2009-07-21  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Split $os->{version} into $os->{major_version} and $os->{minor_version}

2009-07-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Allow TMPDIR to override directory used for temporary files (RHBZ#512905).

2009-07-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generator: Implement RBufferOut and "read-file" call.
	This commit implements the RBufferOut type for returning
	arbitrary 8 bit data from calls.

	We also implement the guestfs_read_file call to read a
	whole file that can contain any 8 bit content, but up to
	a limit of ~ 2 MB.

2009-07-21  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Docs: Fully document the guestfs_readdir ftyp return field.

	Docs: Add "API Overview" section to guestfs(3) manpage.
	This section collects together related API calls, to provide
	more coherent documentation about different ways to carry
	out actions such as uploading and downloading.

2009-07-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Generator: Improve accuracy of a comment.

2009-07-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	virt-inspector --fish: Fix incorrect '-a' parameter (RHBZ#512709)
	virt-inspector --fish dom
	virt-inspector --ro-fish dom

	Both of the above commands give incorrect results if run on a
	libvirt domain, eg:

	$ virt-inspector --ro-fish RHEL54Betax64
	==> --ro -a RHEL54Betax64 -m /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00:/ -m /dev/sda1:/boot
	            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is because the current code just prints back the original @ARGV
	parameters.

	This patch fixes this by getting the image names instead.

2009-07-20  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Replace 'distrofamily' with feature tags
	It turns out that the distribution hierarchy is not as reliable concept as you
	might think. This patch removes distrofamily again.

	Instead of distrofamily, we will add feature tags. This patch adds 2 feature
	tags for Linux distributions:

	package_format (eg rpm/dpkg)
	package_management (eg rhn/yum/apt)

	This change is reflected in the output of virt-inspector

2009-07-18  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	add nls_base.ko and nls_cp437.ko for vfat

2009-07-18  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Make /sysroot path configurable.
	Currently /sysroot is hard-coded throughout the daemon code.

	This patch turns the path into a variable so that we can change
	it in future, for example to allow standalone mode to be implemented.

	This patch was tested by running all the C API tests successfully.

2009-07-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Version 1.0.62.

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://g-rjones@et.redhat.com/git/libguestfs

2009-07-17  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	RHEL 5.4 fix: Check for qemu-kvm binary in /usr/libexec

2009-07-17  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Differentiate 'distro' and 'distrofamily' in Sys::Guestfs::Lib
	Change distro in the output formally known as virt-inspector to reflect the
	actual distro. Possible values are now: fedora, rhel, centos, scientific,
	debian.

	Add new distrofamily entry which is one of: redhat, debian. Currently all
	distros except 'debian' are in the redhat family.

	This allows you to, for example, select a RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux specific
	kernel for installation rather than assuming they're all the same.

	Note this also changes the behaviour of virt-inspector --query. It will now only
	return rhel=yes for RHEL.

2009-07-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	cat: Example of finding DHCP IP address of a VM.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: Ignore perl/Makefile-pl.old

	Fix non-srcdir builds: further fixes to OCaml build rules.

2009-07-16  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fixes for non-srcdir builds: Only include POTFILES from SUBDIRS directories.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: fix OCaml build rules.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: Files generated by configure should be in the tarball.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: Don't include generated *_protocol.c files in POTFILES.

	Don't clean up some non-generated files.

	Fix for non-srcdir builds: more misc fixes.

	Fix for non-srcdir builds: Run src/generator.ml from the srcdir.
	Note that files generated by src/generator.ml are stored in
	the srcdir, *not* the builddir.  The reason is so that they
	can be included in the tarball and will appear in the srcdir
	for tarball builds.

	More misc fixes to non-srcdir builds.

	More misc fixes for non-srcdir builds.

	Miscellaneous fixes for non-srcdir builds.

2009-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New commands: 'mkmountpoint' and 'rmmountpoint'
	These specialized commands are used to create additional mountpoints
	before mounting filesystems.  They are only used where you want to
	mount several unrelated or read-only filesystems together, and need
	additional care to use correctly.

	Here is how to use these calls to unpack the "Russian doll" nest
	of a Fedora 11 live CD:

	 add-ro Fedora-11-i686-Live.iso
	 run
	 mkmountpoint /cd
	 mkmountpoint /squash
	 mkmountpoint /ext3
	 mount /dev/sda /cd
	 mount-loop /cd/LiveOS/squashfs.img /squash
	 mount-loop /squash/LiveOS/ext3fs.img /ext3

	The inner filesystem is now unpacked under the /ext3 mountpoint.

2009-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New command: 'mountpoints' which returns a hash of device -> mountpoint.

2009-07-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Build fix: perl-libintl is not required for the basic Perl bindings.

	Version 1.0.61

2009-07-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	New tool virt-cat: display a file in a virtual machine.
	This script is just a simpler way to cat a file from a VM.  It
	is otherwise equivalent to using guestfish.

	 virt-cat someguest /etc/fstab

	 virt-cat someguest /var/log/messages | tail

2009-07-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Make Perl strings translatable using perl-libintl.
	All Perl strings are now marked as translatable using __"string"
	or __x("string {placeholder}", placeholder => $_).  Perl strings
	now get copied to the PO files.

	The po/POTFILES.in file is now updated automagically whenever we
	add new *.c, *.pl or *.pm files into the repository.

2009-07-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	guestfish: Add tilde expansion for paths (RHBZ#511372).
	This commit adds tilde expansion for local users in guestfish:

	  ><fs> echo "~"
	  ~
	  ><fs> echo ~
	  /home/rjones
	  ><fs> echo ~foo
	  ~foo
	  ><fs> echo ~rjones/bar
	  /home/rjones/bar
	  ><fs> echo ~roo
	  ~roo
	  ><fs> echo ~root/foo
	  /root/foo
	  ><fs> echo ~root
	  /root

2009-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.0.60.

	java/Makefile.inc: Include this generated file.
	We have to include this generated file because it is part of
	the build system, thus required to exist before the generator
	runs.

	File missing from tarball: rc_protocol.x

	Version 1.0.59.

	RHEL 5: header was called <sys/xattr.h>

	Fix: daemon/xattr.c can now compile even when no xattr support.

2009-07-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Guestfish feature: remote control of guestfish over a pipe.
	The use case is to have a long-running guestfish process in
	a shell script, and thus to avoid the overhead of starting
	guestfish each time.  Do:

	 eval `guestfish --listen`

	 guestfish --remote somecmd
	 guestfish --remote someothercmd
	 guestfish --remote exit

	This patch also supports having multiple guestfish processes
	at the same time.

	The protocol is simple XDR messages over a Unix domain socket.

2009-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Removed getfattr/setfattr from TODO list, since now implemented.

2009-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Support for Linux extended attributes.
	This commit adds six calls to support Linux extended attributes.
	They are:
	  getxattrs     list all extended attributes for a file or directory
	  setxattr      add/replace an extended attribute
	  removexattr   remove an extended attribute
	  lgetxattrs    \
	  lsetxattr     (same as above, but operate on symbolic links)
	  lremovexattr  /

	See attr(5) for more information.

	This also adds support for the FBuffer field type, which maps to
	an XDR opaque<> or a C (int, char *) pair.

2009-07-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	virt-inspector: Ignore swap partitions marked as "none".

2009-07-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Improve launch error message.
	The previous error message was confusing for new users:

	  libguestfs: error: guestfs_mount: call launch() before using this function

	The new error message explains the action that the user must take,
	especially if they are using guestfish:

	  ><fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
	  libguestfs: error: guestfs_mount: call launch before using this function
	  (in guestfish, don't forget to use the 'run' command)

2009-07-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add reiserfs module to kernel whitelist.

2009-07-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Only allow virt-v2v to be run on single root guests (ie. no multi-boot).

	Ignore old-style initrd which is a compressed ext2 filesystem.
	'cpio' chokes on these, taking ages to decide that they are
	not cpio files, and producing masses of messages.  This was
	causing virt-inspector to be very slow (many minutes) on
	RHEL 3 guests.  With this fix, speed is back to normal.

	Implement new 'zfile' command, to show file type inside compressed files.

	Ignore java/Makefile.inc (generated file).

2009-07-13  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Automatically generate list of built java sources

2009-07-13  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Revert "Fix checking of generator being run from the right directory."
	This reverts commit 35c646965a21d452cf74ef3683612210a653c36d.

	As well as reverting this change, add a comment explaining that
	configure must run first.

2009-07-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Move BUILT_SOURCES so the comment is back in the right place.

	Order alphabetically the options in guestfish.1 manpage.

2009-07-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish: implement -x option, echo commands before executing them.

	Fix: '-D' was not recognized as a parameter to guestfish.

	Regression test: Test reopening the handle in the same process.

	Guestfish: Add 'reopen' command to reopen the libguestfs handle.

	Add missing documentation for "more" command in guestfish help output.

	Add tests to many non-daemon functions.
	Tests are added to the following functions:
	  get_qemu get_path get_append get_autosync
	  is_ready is_config is_launching is_busy
	  set_memsize get_memsize get_pid

	Add TestOutputIntOp, CompareWithIntOp.
	These constructors allow enhanced tests where we compare
	the result of a test against some operator, eg. >= 1 or < 5

	Test for "version" command should be InitNone.

	Add comment to the code about InitNone and InitEmpty.
	These two constructors are treated as identical, but they
	should be distinct concepts.

2009-07-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix UPDATES and host_cpu in configure.ac.
	UPDATES does not need to be propagated into config.h.

	host_cpu was AC_DEFINE'd twice.

2009-07-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Documentation for virt-v2v.

	V2V outline program.

2009-07-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Don't list Java files explicitly, since these files are auto-generated.

	Version 1.0.58.

	Proposal to add BufferIn and RBufferOut types (not implemented).

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib: Exit with error if a libvirt domain appears to have no disks.

	virt-df: Recognise libvirt domains with file-backed disks.
	File-backed disks (<source file="...">) didn't get recognised
	before.  This patch fixes the problem.

2009-07-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add --version options to virt-df, virt-inspector and virt-v2v.

	Add 'version' call to get true library version number.
	This patch also changes the way that the version is specified
	in configure.ac.  It is now made out of four parts (major, minor,
	release and extra) and constructed for AC_INIT.

	Move 'use File::Temp' from virt-inspector program to Sys::Guestfs::Lib.

	Version 1.0.57.

	Update PO files.

	Additional C files for POTFILES.in.

	Rename internal subroutines with leading underscore character.
	Otherwise Pod::Coverage in the tests will complain that the
	internal subroutines are undocumented.

	Working version of virt-df.

2009-07-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix for returning structures (hashes) from Perl calls.
	Calls such as stat and statvfs which returned a single structure
	were returning an array of values instead of a full hash of keys +
	values.

	Fix this by pushing the key names on the stack too.

2009-07-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	'$_' should be marked as a local variable in Sys::Guestfs::Lib::open_guest.

2009-07-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Properly close fds and unregister handlers in guestfs_close.
	This caused a segfault if you tried to repeatedly open and close
	a guestfs handle in the same program.  The reason is that the
	old handler remained registered (not always - it was racey).

	This adds proper cleanup to the guestfs_close path, also for file
	descriptors.

2009-07-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Added framework for 'virt-df' command.

	Ignore any file called 'localconfigure'.
	Developers should put their custom parameters for configure/autogen.sh
	into a script called ./localconfigure, and this script will be ignored
	by git and the build system.

	Added outline of the virt-v2v script.

2009-07-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Remove virt-inspector --force option - it didn't do anything.

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib minor documentation clean-up.

2009-07-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Move the inspection analysis code into Sys::Guestfs::Lib library.
	Creates new functions:
	  inspect_all_partitions
	  inspect_partition
	  inspect_operating_systems
	  mount_operating_system
	  inspect_in_detail

	Includes far more documentation for the process.

2009-07-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Move 'resolve_windows_path' to Sys::Guestfs::Lib.

	Move 'get_partitions' call into Sys::Guestfs::Lib.

2009-07-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add Sys::Guestfs::Lib - useful functions for using libguestfs from Perl.
	This adds an extra Perl module called Sys::Guestfs::Lib which
	adds useful functions for using libguestfs from Perl.

	The intention is that common code shared between virt-inspector,
	virt-df and virt-v2v will move into this library.

	This patch also changes virt-inspector to use this library.

2009-07-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Just whitespace changes in the generator code.

2009-07-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update with links to the new mailing list.

2009-07-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix checking of generator being run from the right directory.
	Originally it was looking for 'config.status', but this file
	might not exist until configure has been run.  Make it look for
	HACKING instead.

	Version 1.0.56.

2009-07-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	RHEL 5: Mount squashfs with explicit type.

	RHEL 5: Skip 'scrub' test if command is not in the initramfs.

	RHEL 5: 'mkswap -U' not supported, check before testing it.

	Update ocaml/.depend.

	RHEL 5: RHEL kernels don't have $arch at the end, so look for non-arch kernels too.

	RHEL 5: $(builddir) did not exist with this old autoconf/automake, so workaround.

	RHEL 5: for (int i = ...) is not permitted with this old version of GCC.

	Merge branch 'master' of git://git.et.redhat.com/libguestfs

2009-07-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Generate structs and struct lists generically.
	This modifies the way that struct and struct lists are generated
	(for return values) so that there is no need to add an explicit
	new type when adding a new structure.

	All tests pass, and the C API should be compatible.

	I have also inspected the changes that are made to the generated
	code by hand.

2009-07-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix for 349814e9d912c4: Get correct path when building Ruby bindings.

2009-07-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Test two (of four) cancellation paths.

	Add a debug message to the library cancellation path.

2009-07-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Introduce regression tests for various qemu failures.
	Test failure of qemu and recovery of the library:
	 - mid-command
	 - between commands
	 - during launch [test not working yet]
	 - explicitly killed by guestfs_kill_subprocess

	Also this patch cleans up the other tests in this directory
	and disables the long-winded test-bootbootboot test.

2009-07-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	guestfish: Always fflush stdout between commands.

	Whitespace change in ocaml/.depend file.

	Add 'get-pid' command.
	This is used to get the PID of the qemu subprocess, mainly for
	debugging and testing purposes.

	Todo: Remote-control guestfish through a pipe.

	Sort the .gitignore file (no semantic change).

	Remove files generated by autoreconf (Guido Gunter and Matthew Booth).

2009-07-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Don't die if reply message is oversized (RHBZ#509597).

2009-07-04  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	use 'stupid_simple' instead of 'nested' initramfs
	speeds up start of the appliance

	select proper kernel by architecture

2009-07-03  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make it possible to build in a separate directory
	This patch allows you to do:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure ...
	make

	This will output all generated files to the build directory. Given that
	autogen automatically runs configure, you can also do:

	BUILDDIR=./build ./autogen.sh

	which will do the right thing.

	Also:

	* Fix a dependency bug which means that guestfs_protocol.h
	  isn't automatically rebuilt.
	* Re-running autogen.sh with no arguments won't blow away your previous
	  configure arguments.

2009-07-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	generate slightly more "const-correct" code
	* src/generator.ml: Add a few "const" attributes.

	avoid leak upon failed realloc
	* daemon/guestfsd.c (commandrv): Free original buffer (rather
	than leaking it) if realloc fails.

	remove trailing blanks

	daemon/readdir: avoid a small leak
	* daemon/readdir.c (do_readdir): Free both p and v.name, in case
	only one of the allocations failed.

2009-07-03  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	touch fakeroot.log
	indicationg we're done creating the appliance

	remove superflous debirf scripts

2009-07-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish tab-completion on destination paths, fixed this time.
	Tab-completion on destination paths should now work correctly.

	Don't keep rebuilding debirf module symlinks.

	'readdir-and-stat' call is now effectively implemented.

2009-07-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add Debian appliance directory to the distfile.
	'make dist' won't copy symlinks into the output file, so we
	have to add a rule to the Makefile to copy these.

	(Issue reported by Guido Gunther).

2009-07-03  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://192.168.122.1/home/rjones/d/libguestfs

2009-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	use safe_malloc and safe_calloc in generated code
	* src/generator.ml (safe_malloc): Define to guestfs_safe_malloc.
	(safe_calloc): Define to guestfs_safe_calloc.
	[most generated code]: Fail immediately upon failure of otherwise-
	unchecked malloc and calloc calls.
	* src/guestfs.c: Include <stddef.h>.
	(xalloc_oversized): Define.
	* src/guestfs.h (guestfs_safe_calloc): Declare.

	prefer sizeof *VAR over sizeof TYPE (no semantic change)
	* src/generator.ml: Slightly safer, in case the
	declared type ever changes.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Prepare for 1.0.55.  PO files also updated.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add 'sfdiskM' command.
	This command is a saner interface to partitioning.

	All partition sizes are specified in megabytes (not cylinders).
	You don't need to specify the cyls/heads/secs parameters.

	All the test code has been updated to use this, so it is now
	CHS-independent (eg. when CHS changes as between IDE and virtio).

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove generated files guestfs_protocol.[ch].
	These generated files were accidentally left in when we
	removed the other generated files in cset
	b3cb0b04eb2d38ba32c160a83d8e3894b376907b.

	Don't rebuild the whole appliance if just the /init script has been changed.

	Improve virtio-blk performance (RHBZ#509383).

	Add ./configure --with-drive-if=(ide|scsi|virtio)
	With this flag the packager can decide to default to a particular
	qemu drive model.  The current default is 'ide', however note that
	we intend to change this in future to 'virtio' once some upstream
	regressions are fixed.  Packagers can force a particular drive
	model if they wish.

	Add the guestfish 'time' command.
	 ><fs> time sfdisk /dev/sda 0 0 0 ,
	 elapsed time: 6.12 seconds

	Add list of function_names to the daemon.
	Messages which include the proc_nr can now also include the
	name of the actual function being called.

	In verbose mode, daemon will display the time elapsed for each command.

	Ignore generated file appliance/debian/debirf.conf

2009-07-02  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Build Debian based appliance using debirf

	add debirf files

	unconditionally load dm module
	needed for device mapper (LVM)

	add missing module
	for modularized Debian kernels

2009-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	avoid automake failure
	* daemon/configure.ac: Use AM_PROG_CC_C_O, not AC_PROG_CC_C_O.

	arrange to build some generated sources
	* src/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Define.
	($(BUILT_SOURCES)): Depend on stamp-generator.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Re-add src/MAX_PROC_NR (generated file).
	This file is required by configure, so we need to add it so
	it is available after the git checkout.

	Memoize the output of pod2text function in the generator.
	This speeds up the generator greatly.

	Updated PO files.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove generated code from git.
	Git users now require the OCaml compiler in order to regenerate
	the generated code after a checkout.

	Generated code will remain in the tarball, so users of the
	source tarball will not need the OCaml compiler.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generator now runs automatically when it has changed.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add 'readdir' call.
	This adds a readdir call (mostly intended for programs).  The
	return value is a list of guestfs_dirent structures.

	This adds the new types 'struct guestfs_dirent' and
	'struct guestfs_dirent_list', along with all the code to
	return these in the different language bindings.

	Also includes additional tests for OCaml and Perl bindings
	to test this.

2009-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	fish: handle some out-of-memory conditions
	* fish/destpaths.c (xalloc_oversized): Define.
	(complete_dest_paths_generator): Use size_t as type for a few
	variables, rather than int.
	Don't deref NULL or undef on failed heap alloc.
	Don't leak on failed realloc.
	Detect theoretical overflow when count_strings returns a very
	large number of strings.
	Handle asprintf failure.
	(APPEND_STRS_AND_FREE): Rewrite as do {...}while(0), so that each use
	can/must be followed by a semicolon.  Better for auto-formatters.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Call 'udevadm settle' after operations which add/remove device nodes.
	Because udev operates asynchronously, we found errors which were
	caused by a previous command (eg. sfdisk or pvremove) creating
	or removing a device, and that change not having happened by the
	time the next command was run.

	This patch adds calls to '/sbin/udevadm settle' after any commands
	which can add or remove device nodes.

	If udev is not being used or not available, this should have no
	effect.  The command fails and this is silently ignored.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	All instances of 'pclose' now check for return value != 0.
	We are generally interested that the subcommand ran without
	error, ie. had exit status of 0.  'pclose' returns the exit
	status, so we now check that pclose (fp) != 0.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix error handling of external sfdisk command.
	Should use 'pclose' instead of 'fclose' (although fclose happens
	to work because of glibc internals).

	The result of pclose is the exit status of the command, so we
	need to test this is != 0.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for the virtio_blk change.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change to use virtio_blk (virtio block device) by default.
	virtio_blk is the fast, virt-native block device driver
	supported by qemu and KVM.  Note that virtio_blk device
	names are called /dev/vd*.

	Existing scripts should continue working because device name
	translation will silently change device names of the form
	/dev/sd* to /dev/vd* as required.

	See also:
	http://libguestfs.org/guestfs.3.html#block_device_naming

2009-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't dereference or free undefined "msg" upon OOM.
	* src/guestfs.c (guestfs_error): Handle failing vasprintf.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add libguestfs(3) as an alias manpage for guestfs(3).

	Updated PO files.

	Reorder the environment variables alphabetically in the documentation.

	Document the $PAGER environment variable.

	Document the LIBGUESTFS_MEMSIZE environment variable.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change statvfs test so it doesn't depend on device size.
	Current statvfs test depended on a lot of filesystem details
	which can change if the CHS of the underlying block device
	changes (eg. with the switch from IDE -> virtio).  These are
	not really necessary to test the call, so instead just check
	for filesystem features.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Clean up the output of the C API test code.
	Set output mode to unbuffered so that we see ordinary output
	messages and errors at the same time.

	Align "skipped" messages.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo: getfattr, setfattr.

2009-06-30  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Whitelist kernel modules for hardware emulated by QEMU
	(Modified from Guido's original patch to use a wildcard to
	specify all virtio modules - RWMJ).

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for mknod, mkfifo, mknod_b, mknod_c, umask.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New commands: mknod, mkfifo, mknod_b, mknod_c and umask.
	These commands are used to create block and char device
	nodes or FIFOs (named pipes) in the filesystem.

	The umask command is required also because the permissions
	used by mknod are masked by the umask.

	Also document and guarantee that the umask starts as 022.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use octal numbers for modes in the test suite.
	We have to use the OCaml convention (0o...).  Note that in
	OCaml 0777 is a _decimal_ number.  It'll catch you out.

	Generated code for 'set_memsize'/'get_memsize' calls.

	Add 'set_memsize'/'get_memsize' calls.
	Allow the qemu memory size to be specified either by API
	calls or by setting the LIBGUESTFS_MEMSIZE environment
	variable.

2009-06-30  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Use udev if available (Guido Gunter).
	Added support for Fedora's udev (Richard Jones).

	define REDHAT and DEBIAN
	so we can preprocess packagelist.in

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo: Suggest an environment variable for memsize configuration.

	Generated code for the 'mkswap*' commands.

	Implement 'mkswap', 'mkswap_L' and 'mkswap_U' commands.
	These commands are used to make Linux swap devices.  The mkswap_L
	command makes one with a label.  The mkswap_U command makes one
	with a known UUID.

	Todo: Allow memsize to be configured.

	Todo: Investigations into 'binarch' command.

	Rearrange guestfish commands in the manpage.

	Add missing documentation for new 'more' and 'less' commands in guestfish.

	Version 1.0.54

	Check for XML::Writer dependency for virt-inspector.

	Remove generated files in make clean.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Merge commit 'et/master'

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix for 'broken pipe' error when qemu dies (RHBZ#508713).

	Generated code for mount-loop command.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add mount-loop command (RHBZ#508668).
	Loop device mounts don't work for the generic 'mount' commands
	because the first parameter should be a file not a device.

	We want to separate out files parameters from device parameters
	in the long term, so this adds a new mount-loop command for this
	purpose.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix memory leak in daemon/mount.c:do_mount_vfs.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Output the config filename containing a modprobe alias in XML
	This change affects the XML output:

	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/text() =>
	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/modulename/text()

	Additionally there are two new elements:

	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/augeas
	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/file

	These contain information about the location of the alias directive.
	/augeas is an augeas path. /file is the path of the file containing the
	directive.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo list: More suggestions.

	Generated code for 'initrd-list'.

	Add 'initrd-list' command to list contents of initrd images.
	Add 'initrd-list' command to list the files inside (new-style)
	initrd images.  Update virt-inspector to use this instead of
	the less efficient download/unpack locally method.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Add a comment to device naming heuristic

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for 'du' command.

	Added 'du' command.
	This command estimates file usage for files and directories.

	Generated code for df / df-h.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add 'df' and 'df-h' commands.
	df and df-h commands can be used interactively to show disk
	space usage.

	Use existing statvfs command from programs.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo: Removed suggestion for short form for pipes.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement "more" and "less" commands in guestfish.
	Use commands such as:
	  more /etc/passwd
	  less /etc/fstab

	These commands are specific to guestfish.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo list: Pipes now implemented, so remove from list.

	Generated code for head/tail commands.

	Implement "head", "head-n", "tail", "tail-n" commands.
	These commands let you view parts of a large file without
	passing the whole file over the network connection.

	Prevent 'n' being used as a parameter name.
	Parameters named 'n' sometimes break the Perl bindings, so
	check for this in the generator and prevent it.

	Generated code for 'wc_*' commands.

	Todo: wc command done.

	Implementation of 'wc_c', 'wc_w' and 'wc_l' commands.
	These commands count characters, words and lines in a file respectively.

	Implement TEST_ONLY environment variable to run selected tests only.
	To run just selected tests, do:
	  TEST_ONLY="hexdump mkfs" make -C capitests check

	Add large test files with standard content for the C API test.
	Large test files with standard content for the C API test, and
	add a regression test for previous hexdump failure on large files.

	Todo: RUN_ONLY_FOR

	Todo: 'wc' command.

2009-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish pipes.

	Haskell bindings: Implement bindtests.

	Haskell bindings: Int and Int64 return types.

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://g-rjones@et.redhat.com/git/libguestfs

	Haskell bindings: fix boolean arguments.

	Haskell bindings: Fix integer arguments.

2009-06-27  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Clean up XML output
	This change makes XML use XML::Writer, and modifies the output in the
	following 2 ways:

	* /operatingsystems/operatingsystem/os is renamed to
	  /operatingsystems/operatingsystem/name

	* /operatingsystems/kernels/version becomes an attribute of
	  /operatingsystems/kernel for consistency with initrds

2009-06-25  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make virt-inspector look in more places for module aliases
	Specifically:
	/etc/conf.modules
	/etc/modules.conf
	/etc/modprobe.conf
	/etc/modprobe.d/*

	Add yaml output for virt-inspector

	Make run-inspector-locally try to work out where it is installed
	This change means that you can run run-inspector-locally from any
	directory. You can also symlink to it and it'll do the right thing. This
	means you can put a symlink to run-inspectory-locally in your path
	called 'virt-inspector', and 'guestfish -i' will work.

2009-06-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	More TODO items for future work.

	Allow guestfish -i / virt-inspector on live domains, in limited circumstances.

	Fix detection of optional libvirt support in virt-inspector.

	Version 1.0.52.

	Quote command line arguments to virt-inspector.

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://g-rjones@et.redhat.com/git/libguestfs

	Added guestfish -i option to run virt-inspector.
	You can invoke guestfish with:
	 guestfish -i libvirt-domain
	 guestfish -i disk-image(s)

2009-06-24  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Fix dependencies in perl so it doesn't always rebuild

2009-06-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement guestfish -f option to allow guestfish scripts.
	New '-f' option allows scripts to be written using:
	 #!/usr/bin/guestfish -f

	Incorrect assignment on glob error path.

	Todo items: guestfish options -i and -f.

2009-06-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement libtool library versioning.
	Use maximum proc_nr (MAX_PROC_NR) as a surrogate for the
	library ABI version, resulting in version numbers such as
	libguestfs.so.0.<MAX_PROC_NR>.0 for the final library.

	Add ABI guarantee to the documentation.

2009-06-23  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make the supermin helper look for any x86 kernel
	If you've got a non-PAE kernel installed on an i686 machine, the kernel
	architecture is i586. This change makes sure that supermin finds the
	installed kernel.

2009-06-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for 'scrub-*' commands.

	Added 'scrub-*' commands for securely scrubbing filesystems.

	Bump up default guest size to 500M.

	Updated Polish translation (RHBZ#502533).

	Command line argument handling.

	'-no-kqemu' option is no longer necessary to avoid a warning.

	Use --rbind rather than --bind for bind mounting /dev (to get /dev/pts).

	mount /dev via tmpfs before MAKEDEV invocation. This ensures that /dev can be bind-mounted when running commands, as initramfs cannot be bind-mounted.

2009-06-02  Charles Duffy  <cduffy@messageone.com>

	use add_drive_ro for --mount parameters from guestfish when called with --ro
	To prevent writes (such as ext3 journal replay) from occuring even when --ro is
	passed, guestfish should use add_drive_ro() for any drives specified on the
	command line with --add if --ro is also passed.

	As we need to look through the entire command line for --ro before adding any
	drives, we move the add process out of the argument-parsing loop and into its
	own function, patterned off mount_mps().

	build: don't tell "make clean" to remove my '~' backup files
	Hi Rich,

	automake's policy on what to remove via "make clean" is reasonable:
	if running build rules creates it, then "make clean" can and should remove it.
	However, even if build rules happen
	to create backup files, please remove only the specific ones
	they can create, not all of the ones in a directory.  Just in case
	someone relies on those and expect them to hang around...
