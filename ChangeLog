	Version 1.0.84.

	daemon: Don't need to prefix error messages with the command name.
	The RPC stubs already prefix the command name to error messages.
	The daemon doesn't have to do this.  As a (small) benefit this also
	makes the daemon slightly smaller.

	Code in the daemon such as:

	  if (argv[0] == NULL) {
	    reply_with_error ("passed an empty list");
	    return NULL;
	  }

	now results in error messages like this:

	  ><fs> command ""
	  libguestfs: error: command: passed an empty list

	(whereas previously you would have seen ..command: command:..)

	generator: Don't prefix error messages with command name.
	The command name is already being added by the RPC stubs, so
	adding it again in Perl and C# just results in doubled error messages
	like:
	  foo: foo: the error

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib::open_guest: Add interface parameter.
	This allows you to override the default QEMU block device emulation.

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib::open_guest: Remove freeform parameters.
	Remove the ability to pass freeform parameters to Sys::Virt->new.
	We don't use it, it makes the code more complex to modify, and
	indeed there are no other args that Sys::Virt->new supports so
	this would never be used.

	Also change $readwrite to $rw to match parameter name.

	New APIs: add-drive{,-ro}-with-if allows you to set QEMU block emulation.
	The default if=... comes from configure time (currently it
	defaults to if=virtio).

	This change allows you to set the QEMU block emulation.

	We don't think this will be used very often, but virt-v2v
	requires it in order to work around a subtle problem with
	running 'mkinitrd' in an appliance attached to a guest.

	generator: 'interface' is a reserved word in Java.

	add_cdrom: Update docs for adding ISO images.
	See also RHBZ#563450 (NB: This commit does not fix the bug).

2010-02-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use mount-options instead of mount to avoid implicit -o sync.
	guestfs_mount adds -o sync implicitly.  This causes a very large
	performance problem for write-intensive programs (eg. virt-v2v).

	Document this as a "gotcha".

	Change the tests, guestfish, Sys::Guestfs::Lib, guestmount to use
	mount-options instead.

	(Note that this gotcha does not affect mount-ro).

	The source of the performance problem was first identified by
	Matthew Booth.

2010-02-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add -enable-kvm option to qemu command line.
	If the version of qemu being used supports -enable-kvm option,
	then check if /dev/kvm is openable and add this option.

	I have found this option makes no difference, although it is
	*supposed* to enable KVM (hardware virtualization) support.

	New API call: initrd-cat to list a file from an initrd.

2010-02-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Remove invalid Plural-Forms header from ml.po.

	Documentation: Added a section on libguestfs gotchas.

	Make virtio block driver be the default for the appliance.
	Previously this caused a serious performance regression,
	but we believe this is now fixed:

2010-02-08  Ani Peter  <apeter@redhat.com>

	Added Malayalam translations (RHBZ#562710).

2010-02-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Distribute hivexsh.1.html HTML file.

	Update PO files.

2010-02-05  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	RHEL5: Keep old automake happy by defining docdir

2010-02-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add scripts to EXTRA_DIST.

	Update PO files.

	Prepare for version 1.0.83.

	Add files to EXTRA_DIST.

	hivex: example6: Don't double backslashes.

	hivex: example6: Hypothetical addition of keys for viostor.

	hivex: Fix handling of inline VKs.

	hivexsh: Set correct type for 'expandstring' values.

	hivex: Documentation and cleanups.

	hivex: Make limits into macros.

	hivexsh: Remove unused variable.
	This removes an unused variable left over by
	commit ab608f3948d903af64e814b2e67949a1a71d93a4.

	hivex: Complete the implementation of adding child nodes.

2010-02-04  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: More debugging around nk 'unknown2' field.

	hivex: Check hash fields in lf/lh records.

	hivexsh: del command: Fix error message.

	hivexsh: lsval: Remove stray quotation mark.

	hivexsh: cd command: fix error handling
	The error behaviour of hivex_node_get_child is subtle, so the 'cd'
	command wouldn't always report errors correctly.  This fixes it.

	hivex: allocate_block should update valid block bitmap.
	The internal allocate_block() function wasn't updating the bitmap,
	so if you revisited a block which you had allocated in the same
	session, you could get an EFAULT error.

	hivex: More debug messages.

	hivex: Documentation update.
	ntreg_lf_record can have id "lf" (old-style hashes) or "lh" (new-
	style hashes).

	hivex: Some missing le32toh endianness conversions.

	hivexsh: Document some peculiarities of the "cd" command.

	hivex: Implement deleting child nodes.

	hivex: Add flags argument to internal get_children() function.
	When we later call get_children to visit the intermediate
	ri/lf/lh records, we have already deleted the subkey nk-records,
	so checking that those nk-records are still valid is not very
	helpful.

	This commit adds a flag to turn these checks off.

	hivex: Don't die on valid registries which have bad declared data lengths.
	Some apparently valid registries contain value data length
	declarations which exceed the allocated block size for the
	value.

	Previously the code would return EFAULT for such registries.
	However since these appear to be otherwise valid registries,
	turn this into a warning and just use the allocated block size
	as the data length (in other words, truncate the value).

	hivex: Minimal registry example.
	This is the smallest registry you can make and still have it
	load correctly in Windows regedit.

	hivexsh: Add 'setval' and 'commit' commands.
	This adds the 'setval' and 'commit' commands to the hivex shell.

	Also adds some example scripts showing use of these.

	hivex: Begin implementation of writing to hives.
	This implements hivex_node_set_values which is used to
	delete the (key, value) pairs at a node and optionally
	replace them with a new set.

	This also implements hivex_commit which is used to commit
	changes to hives back to disk.

	hivex: Add HIVEX_OPEN_WRITE flag to allow hive to be opened for writing.
	If this flag is omitted (as in the case for all existing callers)
	then the hive is still opened read-only.

	We add a 'writable' flag to the hive handle, and we change the way
	that the hive file (data) is stored.  The data is still mmapped if
	the file is opened read-only, since that is more efficient and allows
	us to handle larger hives.  However if we need to write to the file
	then we have to read it all into memory, since if we had to extend the
	file we need to realloc that data.

	Note the manpage section L</WRITING TO HIVE FILES> comes in a later
	commit.

	Tools for analyzing and reverse engineering hive files.
	This commit is not of general interest.  It contains the tools which
	I used to reverse engineer the hive format and to test changes.
	Keeping these with the rest of the code is useful in case in future
	we encounter a hive file that we fail to modify.

	Note that the tools are not compiled by default.  You have to compile
	each explicitly with:

	  make -C hivex/tools <toolname>.opt

	You will also need ocaml-extlib-devel and ocaml-bitstring-devel.

	hivexsh: Change some exit(1) -> exit(EXIT_FAILURE)

	hivexsh: Only print final \n when interactive.
	When hivexsh was called non-interactively, it would print an
	annoying extra line.  Only print this line if we are being
	used interactively.

	hivexsh: Change handling of prompt argument to rl_gets()
	Make the result of isatty into a global variable (is_tty).

	Change the rl_gets() function so it takes the prompt string
	instead of a "display prompt?" flag.  rl_gets() then consults
	the global to find out if it should display the prompt at all.

	Document that this flag is clear for default keys.

	Misc documentation and gitignore update.

	Move htole*/le*toh macros into a separate header file.
	This allows us to reuse these macros in hivexsh later.

2010-02-04  Sandeep Shedmake  <sshedmak@redhat.com>

	Add Marathi translations (RHBZ#561671).

2010-02-02  Piotr Drąg  <piotrdrag@gmail.com>

	Polish translations (RHBZ#502533).

2010-02-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files.

	Add Gujarti translations (Sweta Kothari) (RHBZ#560918).

2010-02-01  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update Oriya translations (thanks Manoj Kumar Giri) (RHBZ#559498).

2010-01-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	hivex: Reimplement hivexget as a simple shell script.
	hivexget is currently a large C program.  Now that we have hivexsh
	(the shell) we can reimplement hivexget as a simple bash script that
	calls out to hivexsh.

	hivex: Add 'hivexsh' program (shell for navigating registry hives).

	Set locale in C programs so l10n works (RHBZ#559962).
	This commit adds the calls to setlocale &c to all of the current
	C programs.

	It also adds l10n support to hivexget and hivexml which lacked them
	previously.

	To test this, try:

	LANG=pa_IN.UTF-8 guestfish --cmd-help

	(You can only do this test after installing the package, or at
	least the 'pa.mo' mo-file in the correct place).

	Another unreadable file: /var/log/yum.log

	Update PO files.

	Add Tamil translation (RHBZ#559877) (thanks to I.Felix)

	Update Punjabi translation (RHBZ#559480) (thanks Jaswinder Singh)

	Fix regressions/rhbz557655.sh when debugging is enabled (v2).
	The previous fix didn't cope with ordinary warnings emitted by
	qemu (eg. "open /dev/kvm: No such file or directory").  This
	is a hopefully more complete fix for the problem.

	See also commit 3cd7ce75f1ce5048a4d9f6aeaf66aff3194e1096.

2010-01-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix regressions/rhbz557655.sh when debugging is enabled.
	The regression test for RHBZ#557655 would fail if debugging was
	enabled, because debug output would get mixed up with the test
	output.

	To reproduce the error do:

	LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1 make -C regressions TESTS=rhbz557655.sh check

	This commit disables debug for just this test.

	Implement 'vgrename' and 'lvrename' APIs.

	Version 1.0.82.

	hivex: Const-correctness fix on header_checksum (thanks Jim Meyering).

	hivex: Update some previously unknown nk-record fields.
	Update these fields with what we found out from reverse engineering
	the file.  Also bring the unknownX field names into line with
	visualizer.ml.

	hivex: Fix calculation of block size for vk data blocks.

	hivex: Display incorrect block size as unsigned in an error message.

	hivex: display bad block offset in hex

	hivex: hive type in vk-record is an unsigned 32 bit int

	hivex: Add missing le32toh conversion around field access.
	This was missing.  It only worked because we test on a little
	endian platform.

	hivex: Clarify some more fields.
	Taken from sentinelchicken.com documentation.

	hivex: Modify children/values functions to return intermediate blocks.
	Modify the functions that return child subnodes and values so they
	can also be used to return a list of the intermediate blocks.  This
	is so we can delete those intermediate blocks (in a later commit).

	We also introduce an offset_list structure which is used for collecting
	lists of offsets, ie. lists of nodes, values or blocks.

	Note that this commit should not change the semantics of the code.

	hivex: Add value_any callback to the visitor.
	The visitor currently contains lots of value_* callbacks, such as
	value_string which is called back when the value has type string.

	This is fine but it makes it complicated to deal with the case where
	you just want to see 'a value', and don't care about its type.

	The value_any callback allows visitors to see values generically.

	hivex: Move header checksum code into a function.
	This function can be reused later.

	hivex: page 'offset_next' field is really 'page_size'.
	The documentation, as usual, is contradictory.  However this
	field is definitely the page size in all observed registries.
	Furthermore the following field marked 'unknown' is always
	zero, although this contradicts what the sentinelchicken.com
	paper says.

	hivex: Collect more statistics about registries.

	hivex: Store filename in hive handle.

	Added Oriya translations (RHBZ#559498).
	Translation by Manoj Kumar Giri.

	supermin: Add special case for libgcc_s-*.so.N
	Because this file contains the GCC version and a date, it frequently
	changes on the host.  Create a special case so that this file is
	matched using a wildcard for the version/date part of the name.

	Added translations for Punjabi (pa-IN) (RHBZ#559480).
	Translated by Jaswinder Singh.

	Also updated pot files.

2010-01-27  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	supermin: Prevent multilib corruption (RHBZ#558593).
	On some combination of installing, upgrading and removing the base
	libguestfs package on x86_64, multilib can corrupt libguestfs by
	leaving a copy of /usr/bin/libguestfs-supermin-helper around which
	references the wrong architecture (usually, contains links to the
	i386-based appliance, when the x86_64 appliance should be constructed).

	This commit changes libguestfs-supermin-helper so that the script is
	the same on all architectures.  Instead, the library passes the
	differences to the script (eg. $host_cpu).  Because the i386 and
	x86_64 libraries should be at different locations (/usr/lib vs
	/usr/lib64) this should prevent multilib from screwing things up.

	Related links:

	Added Telugu translations (RHBZ#559237).
	Also ran 'make -C po update-po' to update the POT file.

2010-01-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	supermin: Ignore more unreadable files found on RHEL 6.

	Sync to latest Gnulib.

	guestfish: Use xstrtol to parse integers (RHBZ#557655).
	Current code uses atoi to parse the generator Int type and
	atoll to parse the generator Int64 type.  The problem with the
	ato* functions is that they don't cope with errors very well,
	and they cannot parse numbers that begin with 0.. or 0x..
	for octal and hexadecimal respectively.

	This replaces the atoi call with a call to Gnulib xstrtol
	and the atoll call with a call to Gnulib xstrtoll.

	The generated code looks like this for all Int arguments:

	  {
	    strtol_error xerr;
	    long r;

	    xerr = xstrtol (argv[0], NULL, 0, &r, "");
	    if (xerr != LONGINT_OK) {
	      fprintf (stderr,
	               _("%s: %s: invalid integer parameter (%s returned %d)\n"),
	               cmd, "memsize", "xstrtol", xerr);
	      return -1;
	    }
	    /* The Int type in the generator is a signed 31 bit int. */
	    if (r < (-(2LL<<30)) || r > ((2LL<<30)-1)) {
	      fprintf (stderr, _("%s: %s: integer out of range\n"), cmd, "memsize");
	      return -1;
	    }
	    /* The check above should ensure this assignment does not overflow. */
	    memsize = r;
	  }

	and like this for all Int64 arguments (note we don't need the
	range check for these):

	  {
	    strtol_error xerr;
	    long long r;

	    xerr = xstrtoll (argv[1], NULL, 0, &r, "");
	    if (xerr != LONGINT_OK) {
	      fprintf (stderr,
	               _("%s: %s: invalid integer parameter (%s returned %d)\n"),
	               cmd, "size", "xstrtoll", xerr);
	      return -1;
	    }
	    size = r;
	  }

	Note this also fixes an unrelated bug in guestfish handling of
	RBufferOut.  We were using 'fwrite' without checking the return
	value, and this could have caused silent failures, eg. in the case
	where there was not enough disk space to store the resulting file,
	or even if the program was interrupted (but continued) during the
	write.

	Replace this with Gnulib 'full-write', and check the return value
	and report errors.

	Add 'filesize' call.
	Returns the size of a file.  You can already do this with 'stat',
	but this call is good for scripting.

	qemu: Upstream regression of -stdio serial option.
	Best explained by the comment in the code:

	    /* Newer versions of qemu (from around 2009/12) changed the
	     * behaviour of monitors so that an implicit '-monitor stdio' is
	     * assumed if we are in -nographic mode and there is no other
	     * -monitor option.  Only a single stdio device is allowed, so
	     * this broke the '-serial stdio' option.  There is a new flag
	     * called -nodefaults which gets rid of all this default crud, so
	     * let's use that to avoid this and any future surprises.

2009-12-31  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Move guestfs(3) and guestfish(1) man pages into subdirectories.

	daemon: Move prototypes around to keep functions grouped logically.

	Fix error handling in 'zero' function.

	daemon/Win32: Add contributed test script to test daemon using Wine.
	This test script allows you to test limited features of the
	Windows daemon by running it on a standard Fedora host using
	Wine.

	Read contrib/README and contrib/guestfsd-in-wine.sh in detail
	before using.

	Ignore guestfsd.exe (Windows daemon).

	Remove old contrib/febootstrap directory.

	Update PO files.

	Make realpath call optional, disable it for Windows.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	daemon: program_name must be defined for Gnulib error module.

	daemon/Win32: use gnulib modules connect, socket and symlinkat (for readlinkat).

	daemon/Win32: provide htonl, htons, ntohl, ntohs functions.
	These functions are not available on Windows.

	daemon/Win32: Use Gnulib perror module.

	daemon: Link guestfs_protocol.[ch] into the daemon directory.
	Instead of doing a recursive call into the src/ directory to build
	the object files, hard link the source files into the daemon
	directory and build them separately.

	See:
	http://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2009-November/msg00254.html

	Thanks to Jim Meyering for noticing a typo in the original version.

	daemon: Typo generator_build -> generator_built

	daemon: Indent C macros to reflect nesting level.

	daemon/Win32: Win32 can't fork message moved to separate function (Jim Meyering)

2009-11-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfs documentation: Missing space.

2009-11-25  Richard Jones  <rich@koneko.home.annexia.org>

	guestfs: Update architecture section of documentation.

2009-11-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update PO files.

	daemon: Fix build on Unix.

	daemon: Fix sync() call on Unix.

	daemon/Win32: update comment

	daemon/Win32: Supply MAX macro for challenged platforms.

	daemon/Win32: Windows can't daemonize.

	daemon/Win32: Windows replacement for umask.

	daemon/Win32: Replace setenv with Win32 equivalent.

	daemon/Win32: Use xdr_u_int for PortableXDR compatibility.
	PortableXDR didn't support xdr_uint32_t.  xdr_u_int is the same type.

	daemon/Win32: Don't bother blocking SIGPIPE on Win32.

	daemon/Win32: Use gnulib getaddrinfo module.

	daemon/Win32: Implement statvfs using GetDiskFreeSpaceEx.
	At the time of writing Gnulib didn't support Win32 for its
	fsusage API.  Therefore this patch uses GetDiskFreeSpaceEx
	if it's available (on Windows) otherwise falls back to using
	Gnulib fsusage.

	daemon: Move statvfs code into separate file.
	This makes no functional change to the code.  It just moves the
	statvfs-related code out of daemon/stat.c into a new file called
	daemon/statvfs.c.

	daemon: Use gnulib futimens module.
	Instead of checking for futimens support and falling back
	(incorrectly in one case) to using futimes, use gnulib's
	module.

	However the gnulib module does not yet support Win32, so
	this change is only really useful on platforms like RHEL 5.

	daemon/Win32: Use gnulib pread module.

	sync: Windows implementation of sync() call.
	Replace calls to sync() with calls to sync_disks() which supports
	Win32 via FlushFileBuffers.

	daemon: Alternate implementation of posix_fallocate.
	If the posix_fallocate function is not available [ie. Windows]
	use an alternate implementation that just loops and writes.

	dd: Missing include of <string.h>
	Breaks compilation on Windows.

	daemon/Windows: Define _WIN32_WINNT when compiling on Windows.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	supermin: Die with an error if no kernels found (RHBZ#539746).
	Updated with a suggestion from Jim Meyering to use the '-d'
	option to ls to avoid a future case of directories matching.

2009-11-24  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New tool: virt-list-filesystems
	Use this program as a convenient way to list the filesystems
	available in a disk image or libvirt guest.

	Example:

	  $ virt-list-filesystems /dev/vg_trick/Debian5x64
	  /dev/debian5x64/home
	  /dev/debian5x64/root
	  /dev/debian5x64/tmp
	  /dev/debian5x64/usr
	  /dev/debian5x64/var
	  /dev/sda1

	This is designed to make it easier for novices to use guestfish
	and guestmount.  In particular with guestmount this acts as a way
	to get a list of filesystems to use with the '-m' option.  ie:

	  $ virt-list-filesystems unknowndisk.img
	  /dev/sda1
	  /dev/sda2
	  $ guestmount -a unknowndisk.img -m /dev/sda1 /mnt

	availability: Document how to check for single API calls
	This documents how to use autotools and dlopen(3) to test for
	the availability of single API calls at compile time and run time
	respectively.

	availability: Add a test for this call.
	Because all the tested groups are optional, there's not really
	a group we can reliably test, therefore test against the
	empty list (which should not fail).

	availability: Clarify and fix documentation.

	generator: Passing "" to StringList tests should turn into empty list.
	This is a bug in the generator which wasn't being tickled.  If
	you had a test which expected a StringList or DeviceList parameter,
	and you passed "" to that test, then you'd (probably) expect to be
	testing an empty list, but in fact you got a single element list
	containing an empty string.  This fixes it so you get an empty list.

	daemon: Fix return value from aug_defnode.
	Bug fix - the return value from this function was wrong
	in the no-Augeas case.

2009-11-23  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement 'dd' command.

2009-11-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use STRPREFIX instead of STREQLEN.

	generator: second parameter to upload is Dev_or_Path, not String.

2009-11-21  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	build: Add missing dependencies in perl directory
	make all in the perl directory was missing a check that the library had been
	built.

	make check in the perl directory was missing a check that the appliance and test
	images had been built.

	build: Ensure building appliance depends on guestfsd
	Previously, only the update.sh rule checked the daemon had been built. update.sh
	is called directly from within make.sh, so in that path the dependency was never
	checked. This adds the daemon dependency explicitly to the rebuild-from-scratch
	path.

	build: Don't re-check generator.ml for each generator_built in daemon directory

	build: Rebuild the daemon as necessary from other directories
	This change ensure that making the appliance will always rebuild the daemon if
	required.

2009-11-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Update TODO file.

2009-11-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	perl: Add Sys::Guestfs::Lib::feature_available
	This is a nicer Perl wrapper around $g->available call.

	Update the other code in Sys::Guestfs::Lib to use it before using
	LVM, Augeas.

	availability: Skip tests when functions are not available.

	availability: Add optional groups and implement guestfs_available call.
	The current groups are defined very conservatively using the
	following criteria:
	 (a) Would be impossible to implement on Windows because of
	     sheer architectural differences (eg: mknod).
	 (b) Already optional (augeas, inotify).
	 (c) Not currently optional but not implemented on older RHEL and
	     Debian releases (ntfs-3g.probe, scrub, zerofree).

	The optional groups I've defined according to these criteria are:

	 . augeas
	 . inotify
	 . linuxfsuuid
	 . linuxmodules
	 . linuxxattrs
	 . lvm2
	 . mknod
	 . ntfs3g
	 . scrub
	 . selinux
	 . zerofree

	(Note that these choices don't prevent us from adding more
	optional groups in future.  On the other hand to avoid breaking
	ABIs we would not wish to change the above groups).

	The rest of this large commit is really just implementation:

	Each optional function is classified using Optional "group"
	flag in the generator.

	The daemon has to implement a function

	  int optgroup_<name>_available (void);

	for each optional group.  Some of these functions are fixed at
	compile time, and some do simple run-time tests.

	The do_available implementation in the daemon looks up the correct
	function in a table and runs it.

	We document the optional groups in the guestfs(3) man page.

	Also: I added a NOT_AVAILABLE macro in order to unify all the
	existing places where we had a message equivalent to
	"function __func__ is not available".

	availability: Add guestfs_available.
	Start a new API allowing groups of functions to be tested for
	availability.

	There are two reasons for this:

	(1) If libguestfs is built with missing dependencies (eg. no Augeas lib)
	then the corresponding functions are disabled in the appliance.  Up till
	now there has been no way to test for this except to speculatively
	issue commands and check for errors.

	(2) When we port the daemon to Win32 it is likely that major pieces of
	functionality won't be available (eg. LVM support).  This API gives
	a way to test for that.

	There is no change for existing clients: you still have to check for
	errors from individual API calls.

	For new clients, you will be able to test for availability of particular
	APIs.

	Usage scenario (A): An LVM editing tool which requires
	both the LVM API and inotify in order to function at all:

	  char *apis[] = { "inotify", "lvm2", NULL };
	  r = guestfs_available (g, apis);
	  if (r == -1) {
	    /* print an error and exit */
	  }

	Usage scenario (B): A general purpose tool which optionally provides
	configuration file editing, but this can be disabled, the result
	merely being reduced functionality:

	  char *apis[] = { "augeas", NULL };
	  r = guestfs_available (g, apis);
	  enable_config_edit_menus = r == 0;

	daemon/Win32: Use gnulib modules for first porting to Win32.

	generator: open Unix module by default.
	Add:

	  open Unix

	at the top of the generator, which means that we don't need to
	prefix any 'Unix.foo' symbols (we can just use 'foo' instead).

	Unfortunately the Unix module shadows one symbol in Pervasives
	(the Pervasives module is opened by default in OCaml code).  That
	symbol is 'stdout'.  So we replace this with 'Pervasives.stdout'
	in two places.  Still a net reduction in code size.

	Update PO files.

	Update TODO file.

	build: Fix parallel build of haskell bindings
	ghc isn't clever enough not to stomp on itself when building dependencies. This
	change makes the 1 dependency explicit.

	It also adds a dependency on src/libguestfs.la.

	build: Fix inter-directory dependencies
	This change adds an explicit dependency on generator.ml for every file it
	generates, except java files. Java is left for another time because it's
	considerably trickier.

	It also adds a build rule for src/libguestfs.la so it can be rebuilt as required
	from other directories.

	It does this by creating a top level make file, subdir-rules.mk, which can be
	included from sub-directories. sub-directories need to define 'generator_built'
	to include local files which are built by generator.ml, and they will be updated
	automatically.

	This fixes parallel make, and will automatically re-create generated files when
	make is run from any directory.

	It also fixes the problem which efad4f53 was targetting. Specifically,
	src/guestfs_protocol.(c|h) had an erroneous dependency on stamp-generator, and
	therefore generator.ml, despite not being directly created by it. This caused
	them to be recreated every time generator.ml ran rather than only when
	src/guestfs_protocol.x was updated, which cascaded into a daemon and therefore
	appliance update.

	This patch also changes the contents of the distribution tarball by including
	files created by rpcgen.

2009-11-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	generator: Acquire lock to prevent two parallel runs of the generator.
	This commit acquires a lock on a file to prevent two parallel runs of
	the generator from stomping on each other.  The second run will wait
	for the first to complete before starting.

	The lock is acquired on the "HACKING" file because it's convenient --
	we are already checking this file exists to make sure that we don't
	start off in the wrong directory.

	Tested by adding some artificial sleeps in the code to observe
	locking behaviour between two parallel runs.

	daemon/RHEL: Choose correct udev settle script.
	On RHEL/CentOS 5.4, udevadm settle command does not work.  This didn't
	affect us before, but now that we're using parted for partitioning, we
	*do* need to wait for udev to settle (because parted isn't waiting for
	this, unlike sfdisk).

	This commit chooses the correct program to run.

	fuse/RHEL: Don't require UTIME_{NOW,OMIT} to be defined.
	These macros don't exist on RHEL/CentOS 5.4.  If the feature
	is missing then just don't implement it in the FUSE layer.

2009-11-18  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	appliance: Print uptime.
	Print the uptime just before the init script runs the daemon, so we
	have a good idea of how long the kernel boot + init script takes to run.

	recipes: Fix git URL.

	Prepare for version 1.0.79.

	fuse: Add test-fuse.sh to EXTRA_DIST.

	generator: Fix API of functions that return RBufferOut
	(NB: The API / ABI doesn't actually change here - it's just made much
	simpler to use).

	The API for RBufferOut functions was unexpectedly hard to use in the
	case where a zero-length buffer might be returned.  For discussion on
	this see:

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2009-November/thread.html#00115

	This commit ensures that in the zero-length buffer case, the return
	value is never NULL.  Thus code is now able to just check if the return
	value == NULL to indicate an error, which is simpler for all concerned.

	The implementation of this is, however, more complex because we have
	to be careful about this case inside both the daemon and the library
	code, which is what this commit does.

	This has passed a full round of tests.

	fuse: Add tests for guestmount.
	This script contains non-exhaustive tests for the system calls

	meant that empty files could produce spurious error messages.

	fish: Improve output of guestfish -h cmd
	Display this output like a short manual page.

	Don't put <..> around the parameters to the command.

	New API call: fill - fill a file with octets

	fuse: Fix cache invalidation in rename operation.
	We need to invalidate both parameters, otherwise the old (moved)
	file can appear that it still exists after the move.

	fuse: Fix hard link creation.
	The parameters were swapped.  We also need to invalidate the
	cache for both parameters.

	fuse: Fix symlink creation (RHBZ#538069).
	The parameters were swapped, preventing symlinks from being created.

	virt-df: Ignore domains which have ID 0.
	This is the remainder of the fix for RHBZ#538041.  Domains
	which have ID 0 are special domains.  libvirt defines it as
	the "control plane OS".  Only Xen and HyperV have this
	behaviour, and in both cases we should ignore those domains
	for the purposes of virt-df (user can just run "df" if they
	need that information for the dom0).

	virt-df: Turn errors into warnings when listing all domains.
	This is a partial fix for RHBZ#538041.  When listing all domains,
	don't die just because one domain fails, but keep trying for the
	rest.

	appliance: Prefix kernel messages with timestamp.

	Generic partition creation interface.
	This commit introduces a generic partition creation interface
	which should be future-proof and extensible, and partially
	replaces the old sfdisk-based interface.

	The implementation is based on parted but is hopefully not too
	dependent on the particulars of parted.

	The following new calls are introduced:

	  guestfs_part_init:
	    Initialize a disk with a partition table.  Unlike the sfdisk-
	    based interface, we also support GPT and other partition
	    types, which is essential to scale to devices larger than 2TB.

	  guestfs_part_add: Add a partition to an existing disk.

	  guestfs_part_disk:
	    Convenience function which combines part_init & part_add,
	    creating a single partition that covers the whole disk.

	  guestfs_part_set_bootable:
	  guestfs_part_set_name:
	    Set various aspects of existing partitions.

	  guestfs_part_list:
	    List partitions on a device.  This returns a programming-friendly
	    list of partition structs (in contrast to sfdisk-l which cannot
	    be parsed).

	  guestfs_part_get_parttype:
	    Return the partition table type, eg. "msdos" or "gpt".

	The following calls are planned, but not added currently:

	  guestfs_part_get_bootable
	  guestfs_part_get_name
	  guestfs_part_set_type
	  guestfs_part_get_type

	Add ata_piix to kernel module whitelist (RHBZ#533886).

	Fix compilation if readline library is not present.

	Fix compilation when Augeas is not present.
	It would complain that NEED_AUG macro was defined but not used.

	appliance: Enhance mkfs to support many more filesystem types.
	This fixes support for NTFS, and adds support for:
	 - reiserfs
	 - btrfs
	 - GFS and GFS2
	 - JFS
	 - HFS and HFS+
	 - NILFS
	 - OCFS2 (disabled)

	We don't enable OCFS2 by default, because it pulls in about
	140 extra packages into the appliance.

	GFS & GFS2 default to single node (no lock manager etc).

	Fix prototype of commandv to match prototype of commandrv.

2009-11-09  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	daemon: Always reflect command stderr to stderr when debugging.
	When debugging (ie. LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1 & verbose flag set in daemon)
	always reflect any stderr output from commands that we run to
	stderr of the daemon, so it is visible.

	Previously if stderror == NULL in command*, stderr output was
	just eaten and discarded which meant useful error messages could
	be lost.

	daemon: Add flags argument to command*() functions.
	This adds new variations of the command*() functions which
	take a 'flags' argument.  Currently the only flag available
	is defined as follows:

	 COMMAND_FLAG_FOLD_STDOUT_ON_STDERR: For broken external commands
	 that send error messages to stdout (hello, parted) but that don't
	 have any useful stdout information, use this flag to capture the
	 error messages in the *stderror buffer.  If using this flag,
	 you should pass stdoutput as NULL because nothing could ever be
	 captured in that buffer.

	This patch also adds some documentation for command*()
	function.

	fish: Allow <nn>T for terabyte allocations.

	fish: New command 'sparse', like 'alloc' but to generate sparse files.

	To see the real (ie. allocated) size of the sparse file, use the du

	  ><fs> !du -h /tmp/test.img
	  1.6G -rw-rw-r-- 1 rjones rjones 100G 2009-11-04 17:40 /tmp/test.img

	Debian: Use /bin/bash as the shell for regression test scripts.
	/bin/sh on Debian is a minimal shell called 'dash' which doesn't
	support some features we need such as the particular 'function'
	syntax used by regressions/test-stringlist.sh, and therefore
	this script was failing on Debian.

	Change all of these scripts to use #!/bin/bash explicitly to avoid
	these sorts of problems.

	daemon: When running external commands, open stdin as /dev/null
	Previously when we ran external commands from the daemon, stdin
	(ie. fd 0) was closed.  This caused a problem when running the

	This patch opens stdin on /dev/null.

	Add make.sh.in to EXTRA_DIST.

	Comment out code which provokes strange gcc optimization error.

	Prepare for 1.0.77.

	FUSE filesystem support.
	This implements FUSE filesystem support so that any libguestfs-
	accessible disk image can be mounted as a local filesystem.

	Note: file writes (ie. write(2) system call) is not yet implemented.

	The API needs more test coverage, particularly lesser-used system
	calls.

	The big unresolved issue is UID/GID mapping between guest filesystem
	IDs and the host.  It's not easy to automate this because you need
	extra details about the guest itself in order to get to its
	UID->username map (eg. /etc/passwd from the guest).

	Allow callers to disable the recovery process.

2009-11-02  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API call: pread
	guestfs_pread lets you do partial file reads from arbitrary
	places within a file.  It works like the pread(2) system call.

	New API calls: lstatlist, lxattrlist, readlinklist.
	These three functions are very specifically designed for FUSE
	support, so we can list directories efficiently.  Instead of
	making lots of lstat, lgetxattr and readlink calls, we can make just
	three calls per directory to grab all the attributes (which we
	then cache briefly).

	New API calls: truncate, truncate_size, mkdir_mode, utimens, lchown.
	truncate, truncate_size: Used to truncate files to a particular
	size, or to zero bytes.

	mkdir_mode: Like mkdir but allows you to also specify the
	initial permissions for the new directory.

	utimens: Set timestamp on a file with nanosecond accuracy.

	lchown: Corresponding to lchown(2) syscall (we already have chown).

	The implementation is complicated by the fact that we had to
	add an Int64 parameter type to the generator.

	examples/to-xml.c: Don't depend on Gnulib function.
	Since this program is just an example, it shouldn't require
	the Gnulib c-ctype functions.

	appliance: Don't rebuild the appliance every time configure runs.
	config.status touches make.sh each time it runs, even if the
	resulting script would not change.  This causes the appliance
	to get rebuilt much more frequently than is necessary.

	There's no way to stop configure running, but we can move the
	config.status command into a Makefile rule to stop this
	undesirable behaviour.

	guestfish: Fix a third indentation problem.

	guestfish: Another indentation fix.

	guestfish: Fix printing of buffers in structs.
	Somehow an 'indent' string crept in there, so it was printing:

	  <char><indent><char><indent><char>...

	instead of:

	  <char><char><char>...

	Fix rstructs_used handling in guestfish generated code.
	rstructs_used wasn't correctly generating code for guestfish
	because guestfish doesn't make all functions visible.  Since the
	calculation of rstructs_used was over all functions (including
	ones not available in guestfish) it could have generated
	unnecessary functions.

	In fact this error didn't affect us before - but I discovered
	it when I added some extra struct-returning functions (future
	commit).

	daemon: Don't warn on -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations.
	Ignore -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations, same as in the top level
	configure file.

	Support for Windows Registry.
	In hivex/:  This mini-library allows us to extract Windows

	There are also two tools: hivexml converts a hive to a
	self-describing XML format.  hivexget can be used to extract
	single subkeys from a hive.

	New tool: virt-win-reg.  This is a wrapper around the library
	functionality allowing you to pull out data from the registries
	of Windows guests.

2009-10-26  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New API: vfs_type - get the Linux VFS driver for a mounted device.

	Modify Sys::Guestfs::Lib::resolve_windows_path to use case_sensitive_path.

	guestfish: Add win: prefix to use Windows paths.
	Add a win: prefix for path arguments in guestfish:

	><fs> file win:c:\windows\system32\config\system.log
	MS Windows registry file, NT/2000 or above

	daemon: Change chdir to use openat/fdopendir.
	Uses Gnulib implementation of openat which should be portable.

	New API: case-sensitive-path to return case sensitive path on NTFS 3g fs
	This function handles an annoyance/peculiarity of the Linux
	NTFS 3g driver, which is that it exports NTFS filesystems with
	names case sensitive, even though under Windows they would be
	case insensitive.

	This causes problems because the location of (eg.) c:\windows
	might appear as /windows or /WINDOWS (etc) depending on the
	inconsequential details of how it was originally created.

	Example of this problem on a real Windows guest:

	  ><fs> file /windows/system32/config/system.log
	  libguestfs: error: file: access: /windows/system32/config/system.log: No such file or directory
	  ><fs> case-sensitive-path /windows/system32/config/system.log
	  /WINDOWS/system32/config/system.LOG
	  ><fs> file /WINDOWS/system32/config/system.LOG
	  MS Windows registry file, NT/2000 or above

2009-10-20  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.0.74.

	Tab to space fixes, now passes 'make syntax-check'

	guestfs_find: Fix memory leak of sysrootdir.

	virt-ls: Modify to use find0 instead of find.
	find0 is more scalable than find.  virt-ls will no longer
	crash if asked to recursively list / on a Linux guest.

	New API: find0 (unlimited version of find)
	This adds a new API call guestfs_find0, which is like guestfs_find
	but mainly doesn't suffer from the protocol limit of the earlier
	command.  The earlier command is not deprecated because it is
	still very useful.

	guestfs_find0 uses a FileOut parameter and writes the results to
	an external file.  The filenames in the output are separated by
	ASCII NUL characters (so a bit like "find -print0").

	There is also the addition of a regression test for this command.

	guestfs_find: Document protocol limits for this API call.
	guestfs_find has to send the complete list of files in a single
	protocol message (hence, limited to 2-4 MB).  Unfortunately on
	a typical Linux guest, guestfs_find ("/") will exceed this limit
	resulting in an error.

	Therefore we should add an unlimited version of this call in a
	future commit.  This commit just documents the current limit.

	New tool: virt-ls
	This tool makes available the functionality of "ls", "ll", and "find"
	in a slightly simpler to use form.

	Examples:

	  virt-ls -l myguest /tmp

	New tool: virt-tar
	This adds a new tool call virt-tar which is a general purpose
	archive and uploading tool.  It doesn't add any functionality
	which wasn't previously possible using guestfish, but makes it
	simpler to access for some users.

	Examples:

	 virt-tar -zx myguest /home home.tar.gz
	 virt-tar -zu myguest uploadstuff.tar.gz /tmp

2009-10-19  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	tools: Make warnings about running on live guests more prominent.
	Add prominent warnings to the man pages about how it is dangerous
	to run these tools against live guests.

	Move virt tools (virt-cat, virt-edit etc) into tools/ subdirectory.
	This moves the tool programs into a single directory:
	  cat/* -> tools/virt-cat
	  df/* -> tools/virt-df
	  edit/* -> tools/virt-edit
	  rescue/* -> tools/virt-rescue

	This in itself simplifies the build process because we only need
	one Makefile and one copy of 'run-locally'.

	'run-*-locally' has become just 'run-locally' and takes an extra
	parameter which is the name of the tool, eg:
	  run-locally cat [virt-cat params...]

	virt-inspector stays in its own directory, because this contains
	more than just a single Perl script.

	Comment: Describe the build order requirements for toplevel directories.

2009-10-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	inspector: Generate language bindings for OCaml.
	This commit adds a generic mechanism for deriving language bindings
	for virt-inspector, and implements one concrete binding, for OCaml.

	The bindings are generated from the RELAX NG schema (virt-inspector.rng)
	which is supposed to be a correct and always up to date description
	of the XML that the virt-inspector program can generate.

	From the RNG we generate a set of types to describe the output of
	virt-inspector for the language, plus an XML parser, plus some
	glue code to actually run an external instance of virt-inspector
	and parse the resulting XML.

	At runtime, an external 'virt-inspector --xml <name>' command runs
	and the XML is parsed into language-specific structures.

	This has been tested on the four example files (inspector/example?.xml)

	The only particular difficulty about the OCaml binding is the use of
	Obj.magic, which is naughty but works because of the isomorphism
	between the representation of tuples and records in OCaml.  This
	seems to cause no problems in my test program.  Apart from this, the
	OCaml binding is straightforward and could be adapted easily for any
	other languages that want type-safe virt-inspector bindings.

	It's important to keep virt-inspector.rng up to date with changes
	to virt-inspector's XML output format.

	Rename virt-[tool].pl as virt-[tool]

	Check return value from readlink.

	Create manpage atomically.
	Don't fail with a partial file if disk full, etc.

	Replace @...@ with $(...) in these common Makefile.am files.

	guestfish: Update 'SEE ALSO' section of the manpage.

	New tool: virt-edit
	Edit any file in a guest.  This was possibly previously
	using guestfish, but having a separate command makes it
	simpler.

	The usage is simply:

	  virt-edit mydomain /some/file

	It runs $EDITOR or vi on the file, and if the user changes
	it, uploads the result back to the VM.

	virt-cat: Remove some unused Perl module includes.

	Add 'virt-rescue' command.
	This command runs a "rescue appliance" against a virtual machine
	or disk image.  This is useful for making ad-hoc interactive
	changes to virtual machines.

	  $ virt-rescue --ro /dev/vg_trick/F11x64

	  Welcome to virt-rescue, the libguestfs rescue shell.

	  Note: The contents of / are the rescue appliance.
	  You have to mount the guest's partitions under /sysroot
	  before you will be able to examine them.

	Add direct appliance mode flag and implementation.
	When the g->direct flag is set, the appliance stdin/stdout
	are not connected to the library.  Instead they inherit the
	stdin/stdout of the caller.

	This is used to implement virt-rescue.

	Tidy up appliance rescue code.
	The appliance shouldn't run the daemon after we leave the
	rescue shell.  It should just exit instead.

	Rejig configure.ac tests for qemu vmchannel support.
	vmchannel is no longer required, so we shouldn't test for it.
	However we should test instead for user mode networking support.

	Also fix up the documentation / error messages.

	Always test for vmchannel and user mode networking support in
	qemu.  This gives us more troubleshooting information if people
	report bugs.

2009-09-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Prepare for 1.0.71.
	Update version number and update PO files.

	Put latest version and release date on the website front page.

	Change handling of spaces on Linux kernel command line.

	Update documentation of qemu / vmchannel.

	Implement "null vmchannel" - no vmchannel needed!
	This commit removes the requirement for vmchannel, although retaining
	support for it.

	In this configuration, known as "null vmchannel", the library
	listens on a random loopback port.  It passes the number of this
	port to the appliance (guestfs_vmchannel=tcp:10.0.2.2:12345), and
	the daemon then connects back.  The library, instead of connecting,
	listens and accepts the connection during guestfs_launch.

	QEMU SLIRP (user mode networking) is still required to make this
	work: SLIRP forwards the TCP connection transparently (instead of
	explicitly as with guestfwd) to 127.0.0.1:<port>

	There is a window in which any other local process on the machine
	could see the port number in the qemu command line and try to
	connect to it.  This would be a devastating security hole, because
	any local process could pretend to be the daemon and feed back
	malicious replies to our remote procedure calls.  To prevent this,
	we check the UID of the other side of the TCP connection.  If
	the UID is different from the library's EUID, then we reject the
	connection.  To do this we have to parse /proc/net/tcp.  (On Solaris
	we could use getsockopt (SO_PEERCRED), but this doesn't work on
	Linux TCP sockets).

	Other vmchannel(s) are still supported.  This is important, because
	we can't in general be sure the qemu will always support SLIRP.
	In particular, in recent versions of qemu it is possible to compile
	out SLIRP.

	Gnulib: Add arpa-inet and netinet-in modules.

	Flexible guestfs_vmchannel parameter for future appliances.
	This reimplements parts of commit da0a4f8d1f6ddd302ceba028d87c6e009589e503
	in a different, but compatible way.

	We pass guestfs_vmchannel=tcp:<ip>:<port> on the command line.  This
	is intended to be used as follows (now and in future versions):

	  tcp:10.0.2.4:6666    for guestfwd vmchannel
	  tcp:10.0.2.2:<port>  for future "no vmchannel" implementation
	  /dev/vcon4           for future virtio-console vmchannel*

	It also accepts the old-style guestfs=10.0.2.4:6666 parameter which
	is sent by older libraries, and turns this transparently into the
	correct format above.

	If no guestfs_vmchannel is passed, then this defaults to the guestfwd
	vmchannel which older libraries would expect.

	* Maybe this last one should be dev:/dev/vcon4 or file:/dev/vcon4, but
	we don't need to decide that now.

	Rearrange and tidy up code in guestfsd.c
	This just tidies up the main() function in the daemon.  There is
	no longer a huge fixed-sized buffer used for the kernel command
	line.  Variables are moved closer to where they are used.  Some
	local variables turned out to be unused - these are removed.  Finally
	the part that reads the kernel command line is moved into a separate
	function.

	There is only minimal functional change here (it now prints out
	the kernel command line).

	Literal '4' replaced with 'sizeof' expression, at Jim Meyering's
	suggestion during patch review.

2009-09-21  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Make GUESTFWD_PORT into a string.

	Remove unnecessary extra space from qemu command line.

	Remove guestfs_wait_ready (turn it into a no-op).
	This commit changes guestfs_launch so that it both launches
	the appliance and waits until it is ready (ie. the daemon communicates
	back to us).

	Since we removed the pretence that we could implement a low-level
	asynchronous API, the need to call launch() followed by wait_ready()
	has looked a bit silly.

	Now guestfs_wait_ready() is basically a no-op.  It is left in the
	API for backwards compatibility.  Any calls to guestfs_wait_ready()
	can be removed from client code.

	Combine temporary buffers.
	buf[], append[] and memsize_str[] were all temporary buffers
	used in non-overlapping code.

	Combine them to use a single buffer (buf[]).

	Rearrange qemu command line order (no functional change).

2009-09-18  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Enable new-style -chardev ... guestfwd command line.
	Newer versions of qemu have changed the command line format
	(again).  '-net channel' is now deprecated.  Instead we use:

	    -chardev socket,id=guestfsvmc,path=/path/to/sock,server,nowait
	    -net user,vlan=0,net=10.0.2.0/8,guestfwd=tcp:10.0.2.4:6666-chardev:guestfsvmc
	    -net nic,model=ne2k_pci,vlan=0

	The old style format is still used if the new style is not
	detected at runtime.

2009-09-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix code which looked for leaked FDs between each command.
	This code was not checking the return value from system()
	so it failed if uncommented.  Add ignore_value() around the
	call to system.  However, leave the code still disabled.

	Remove explicit guestfs=10.0.2.4:6666 kernel command line parameter.
	Since we control the appliance tightly, we can just specify
	that it will always use a particular host and port, and we
	don't need to pass it on the command line each time.

	Also the VMCHANNEL_* constants are only relevant to the
	particular guestfwd vmchannel implementation, so we rename
	them as GUESTFWD_*.

	Daemon: fix handling of errors from xread and xwrite.
	If xread or xwrite returns -1, that indicates an error and we
	should exit.  Note that xread/xwrite has already printed the
	error message.

	Fix verbose packet dumping functions.
	Add the configure parameter --enable-packet-dump so that this
	code can be enabled without editing the source.

	This code is normally commented out, because it is too verbose
	unless you happen to be debugging the underlying protocol.  Because
	it is normally commented out, I found it had bit-rotted slightly.
	This commit also fixes the obvious problems.

	'len' should be an unsigned 32 bit int.
	This only happened to work by accident before because 'unsigned len'
	happens to be 32 bit on all platforms we support.

	Disable -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations
	This warning indicates that GCC could not do a particular sort
	of loop optimization.  It pops up randomly in certain forms of
	looping code, and seems safe to ignore.

2009-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update PO files (no functional change).

	Prepare for version 1.0.70.

	Update PO files.

	Set minimum gettext version to 0.17.
	This fixes the problem that the 1.0.69 tarball would fail in
	the po/ subdirectory when installing:

	make[1]: Entering directory `/builddir/build/BUILD/libguestfs-1.0.69/po'
	/bin/sh @MKINSTALLDIRS@ /builddir/build/BUILDROOT/libguestfs-1.0.69-1.fc11.x86_64/usr/share
	/bin/sh: @MKINSTALLDIRS@: No such file or directory
	make[1]: Leaving directory `/builddir/build/BUILD/libguestfs-1.0.69/po'

	RHEL 5.3 has gettext 0.14.6.  However the tarball will still
	build (since it includes all the required code).  This may cause
	a problem if RHEL users want to build from the git repository.

2009-09-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Fix comparison between signed and unsigned (for RHEL 5).

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Move decl out for C99 compliance.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update PO files.

	Move guestfs-internal-actions.h to EXTRA_DIST.

	Prepare for 1.0.69.

	Remove main loop.
	This commit removes the external main loop, which never worked
	and caused a number of bugs.  Requests are now done synchronously,
	and if the user wants to have requests issued in the background
	or to have a responsive GUI, then they'll just have to use threads.

	The big change is to push all reads and writes through two
	functions called send_to_daemon (for writes) and recv_from_daemon
	(for reads) which operate synchronously.  These functions
	read/write whole messages, and also handle checking for EOF
	(ie. daemon died) and asynchronous log message events from
	qemu (eg. from debug / dmesg printed by the guest).  A more
	complete description of how these work can be found in the code.

	This code passes a complete run of the tests.

	Bugs believed to be fixed by this commit:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=501888
	  internal error: reply callback called twice

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=504418
	  In virt-inspector: "download: guestfs_download reply failed, see earlier error messages"

	I have tried to avoid reintroducing this:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=508713
	  libguestfs: error: write: Broken pipe (guestfish only)

	One other benefit of this is that 'set_busy/end_busy' calls
	no longer appear in traces.

	Don't enable trace in set_trace test.
	This leaves trace enabled afterwards, resulting in some
	ugly test messages.

	Fix type punning warning about use of CMSG_DATA in Rawhide.

2009-09-14  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Enable grouping in string lists
	This change adds the ability to group entries in a string list with single
	quotes. So the string:
	  "'foo bar'"
	becomes 1 token rather than 2. Consequently single quotes must now be escaped:
	  "\'"
	resolves to a literal single quote.

	Incidentally, this change also alters another, probably unintentional behaviour
	of the previous implementation, in that tokens are separated by any amount of
	whitespace rather than a single whitespace character. I.e.:
	  "a  b"
	resolves to:
	  'a' 'b'
	rather than:
	  'a' '' 'b'
	That last syntax can be used if an empty argument is still desired. Whitespace
	is now also defined to include tabs.

	parse_string_list can also now fail if it contains an unmatched open quote.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Ignore localrepo/ directory.
	This can be used by people building from source and packagers for
	their own purposes.

	Add command trace functionality.
	Enable this by calling guestfs_trace (handle, 1) or by
	setting the LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1 environment variable.

	Non-daemon actions indirect through generated code.
	Previously non-daemon actions were called directly by
	user code, eg:

	/* Non-generated */
	int
	guestfs_set_verbose (guestfs_h *g, int v)
	{
	  g->verbose = !!v;
	  return 0;
	}

	This changes these actions so they go indirectly via
	some generated code, eg:

	/* Generated */
	int guestfs_set_verbose (guestfs_h *g,
			int verbose)
	{
	  return guestfs__set_verbose (g, verbose);
	}

	/* Non-generated */
	int
	guestfs__set_verbose (guestfs_h *g, int v)
	{
	  g->verbose = !!v;
	  return 0;
	}

	The aim is to have a place in the generated code where
	we can add debug or tracing information for these non-
	daemon calls.

2009-09-14  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Redirect stdout when executing remote commands
	guestfish --listen necessarily redirects its stdout to /dev/null so as not to
	interfere with eval. The remote protocol doesn't contain any other provision for
	collecting stdout for the caller, so executing guestfish --remote will never
	generate any output.

	This patch fixes that by forwarding the caller's STDOUT to the listener over the
	unix socket connection. The listener redirects its STDOUT to the caller's STDOUT
	for the duration of the command, then closes it again.

2009-09-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update TODO list

	Add diffutils package.

	mke2fs: Use e4fsprogs programs if available.
	On RHEL 5, mke2fs is ancient, and there is a non-standard "mke4fs"

	use mke4fs instead if it's available.

	generator.ml: convert leading TABs to spaces

	sfdisk: guard against buffer overflow
	* daemon/sfdisk.c (sfdisk): Don't let outrageous "extra_flag"
	or "device" strings overflow a fixed-size buffer.

	do_umount: don't use RESOLVE_DEVICE anymore
	* daemon/mount.c (do_umount): Don't use RESOLVE_DEVICE here,
	now that the caller always invokes REQUIRE_ROOT_OR_RESOLVE_DEVICE.

	generator.ml: factor out "pr_args n" function

	generator.ml: finish adding Dev_or_Path support
	* src/generator.ml: Update all rules to handle Dev_or_Path.

	Emit a use of REQUIRE_ROOT_OR_RESOLVE_DEVICE.
	* daemon/upload.c (do_download): Remove use of
	REQUIRE_ROOT_OR_RESOLVE_DEVICE, now that it's automatically done
	in calling code.
	* daemon/file.c (do_file): Likewise.

	generator.ml: add type: Dev_or_Path
	* src/generator.ml (file, download): Use it.

	* src/generator.ml (mkdtemp): Declare parameter to be of type Pathname.

	generator.ml: move String/Device decls "down" to definition

	generator.ml: use new "Pathname" designation
	Nearly every file-related function in daemons/*.c is affected:
	Remove this pair of statements from each affected do_* function:
	-  NEED_ROOT (return -1);
	-  ABS_PATH (dir, return -1);
	and change the type of the corresponding parameter to "const char *".
	* src/generator.ml: Emit NEED_ROOT just once, even when there are two or
	more Pathname args.

	generator.ml: new type, "Pathname"
	* src/generator.ml: Emit NEED_ROOT and ABS_PATH into generated
	stubs.c, rather than requiring they be added manually at the start
	of each and every do_* function that operates on a "path" parameter.
	Update grammar: Pathname is just a String, with the above exception.
	Do not update augeas "path" parameters, since they are not file names,
	but rather ":"-separated search paths.  Except aug_init, for which
	"path" *is* a file name.

	generator.ml: emit "const char *" for Device and String params
	* src/generator.ml: Emit "const char *", not "char *" for Device and
	String params, now that the non-const code is hoisted into the calling
	code in stubs.c.

	fix daemon.h's use of NEED_ROOT-in-#define

	update all NEED_ROOT uses

	* src/generator.ml: Change all `String "device"' to `Device "device"'.

	now that it's generated in caller from stub.c.
	* daemon/blockdev.c (call_blockdev): Remove use of RESOLVE_DEVICE.

	propagate semantic changes to NEED_ROOT, NEED_ROOT_OR_IS_DEVICE
	changing IS_DEVICE semantics leads to changing semantics of
	NEED_ROOT_OR_IS_DEVICE and NEED_ROOT, too.
	* daemon/daemon.h: Update definitions.

	convert the last few, manually

	change almost all uses: s/IS_DEVICE/RESOLVE_DEVICE/

	* daemon/daemon.h (RESOLVE_DEVICE): Rename from IS_DEVICE.

	generator.ml: define new String-like type: "Device"

2009-08-13  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Don't assume grub is on a separate boot filesystem
	Paths in grub.conf are relative to the filesystem containing it. grub parsing
	currently assumes that it is on /boot, and will fail if it isn't, for example
	because a guest only has a single partition.

	This patch makes grub parsing work harder to work out what grub paths are
	relative to. Firstly, it looks for a previous detected 'linux-grub' filesystem.
	If this isn't found, it tries to work out which filesystem contains
	/boot/grub/menu.lst and uses that.

2009-08-13  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	add_drive: Don't use cache=off if not supported by underlying filesystem.
	If you use the guestfs_add_drive function, then currently it
	generates a qemu command line element like:

	  -drive ...,cache=off,...

	This causes qemu to try to open the device with O_DIRECT.
	Unfortunately some filesystems don't support this flag, notably tmpfs,
	which means you can't use libguestfs in conjunction with tmpfs.  On
	some systems /tmp is a tmpfs filesystem.

	This patch fixes this so that if the filesystem doesn't support
	O_DIRECT, then we omit the cache=off parameter.  This seems reasonable
	from a reliability point of view, because if you're using tmpfs then
	you probably didn't expect reliability in the case where your system
	suddenly powers off.

2009-08-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add 'setcon', 'getcon' commands to set and get the SELinux context.

2009-08-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Return error if allocations fail.

	Add documentation for SELinux configuration.
	Also use L</...> to link between sections.

	Spelling fix: labelled -> labeled.

	If using SELinux, mount /selinux in the appliance.
	If selinux=1 on the Linux kernel command line, then we mount
	/selinux in the appliance.  We will also bind-mount this
	directory into guests when we run commands.

	Allow selinux=? kernel flag to be controlled.
	Adds new API calls to set and get this flags.

2009-08-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	fish: don't read freed memory
	* fish/rc.c (rc_remote): Close file handle only *after* xdr_destroy,
	because that latter may flush its file handle (implicated via
	xdrstdio_create).  FYI, this failure is triggered for me only when
	MALLOC_PERTURB_ is set to nonzero < 256 in my environment.

	doc: improve emacs snippets
	* HACKING: Make (setq indent-tabs-mode nil) apply to nearly all
	files, not just C-mode ones.

2009-08-12  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fix regression test rhbz503169c10.sh.
	'll' command has changed semantics very slightly
	(see commit 6727e7c8bdf1cb39264a9de6333d228b51c39956).
	We need to fix this test so it doesn't try to run
	the ll command without a mounted disk.

2009-08-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add contents of /proc/mounts to the debugging information.

2009-08-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	daemon/ls: make do_ll require root, like all the rest
	* ls.c (do_ll): Do invoke "NEED_ROOT" here, and add a FIXME to
	provide a "debug ll" command with the semantics we're removing.

2009-08-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: avoid first-time configure-from-clone failure
	* bootstrap: Run autopoint before using the file it creates,
	po/Makevars.template.  Reported by Richard Jones.  Details here:
	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2009-August/msg00135.html

	build: enable automake's silent rules option
	* configure.ac: Use AM_SILENT_RULES([yes]).
	Those who want verbose build output may configure with
	--disable-silent-rules or use "make V=1".
	* daemon/configure.ac: Likewise.

	build: daemon/do_debug: parameters aren't always unused
	* daemon/debug.c (MAYBE_UNUSED): Define.
	(do_debug): Mark parameters as unused only when they really
	are unused.  Spotted by Richard Jones.

	SCALAR(0xdd8370)
	prefer sizeof *VAR sizeof TYPE (no semantic change)

	build: avoid warnings in daemon/inotify.c
	Avoid "comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions"
	warnings.  If it's at all hard or risky to avoid this type of warning,
	then it's not worthwhile.  Here, it's easy and safe.
	* daemon/inotify.c (inotify_posn): Declare local to be of unsigned type.
	(do_inotify_read, do_inotify_files): Likewise.

	build: avoid warnings in daemon/guestfsd.c
	* daemon/guestfsd.c (print_arginfo, print_shell_quote): Mark each
	"info" parameter as unused.

	build: avoid warnings in daemon/debug.c
	* daemon/debug.c (do_debug): Mark parameters as unused.

	define ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED
	* daemon/daemon.h (__attribute__, ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED): Define.

	daemon/file.c: remove duplicate absolute-path check
	* daemon/file.c (do_file): Remove redundant use of ABS_PATH.
	It's redundant because the preceding line invokes NEED_ROOT_OR_IS_DEVICE,
	which also invokes ABS_PATH.

2009-08-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Tidy up generation of java/Makefile.inc.
	(Just whitespace and comment changes, and small restructuring
	of the code).

	Debug: Improve the way the qemu command line is printed.
	Change the way the qemu command is displayed to look like
	this:

	/usr/bin/qemu-kvm \
	    -drive file=/tmp/test.img,cache=off,if=virtio \
	    -m 500 \
	    -no-reboot \
	    -kernel /tmp/libguestfsHBJHRh/kernel \
	    -initrd /tmp/libguestfsHBJHRh/initrd \
	    [...]

	This allows the command line to be copied and pasted directly
	into the shell, and also makes it simpler to read.

	Allow network interface to be configured.
	Add ./configure --with-net-if=(virtio|ne2k_pci) option.

	This lets you workaround the following virtio_net bug:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=516022

	Tests: swapon_device test mkswap /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sdb.
	On RHEL 5, mkswap /dev/sdb fails, even with the '-f' option
	(contradictory to what the manual page says).

	This commit adds a new 'InitPartition' initialization which
	just creates /dev/sda1, and then does the swap test on that.

2009-08-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Always pass mkswap -f parameter.
	Otherwise mkswap will give a silly error if you ask it to
	swap on a whole device.

	Tests: Don't test block size in statvfs test.
	The block size changes between kernel releases, causing
	a false failure in the tests.  The error was:

	test_statvfs_0: bsize was 65536, expected 131072

	Version 1.0.66

	RHEL 5: inotify_init1 call did not exist on RHEL 5.

	Fix: segfault in tab completion (RHBZ#516024).
	Actually this fixes two bugs: 'strs' was not being freed on every
	path, and the tab completion segfault described in the bug report.

2009-08-06  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Fix errno check in readdir in devsparts.c

2009-08-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add ne2k-pci driver to the appliance.
	This allows people to use the ne2k-pci network driver, for those
	situations where the virtio_net driver is broken (cough 516022 cough).

	Make user network numbering explicit.
	Use:
	 -net user,vlan=0,net=10.0.2.0/8
	just to make the (already implicit) 10.0.2.x network explicit.

	appliance: More debug added to /init.

2009-08-06  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Exclude daemon/lib and daemon/tests from being added to po/POTFILES.in

2009-08-06  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: remove bootstrap's --gnulib-srcdir option
	...because it probably didn't work, and even if it did, we've
	discovered that using a separate git repo like that can lead
	to subtle mix-ups.
	Also, fix invocation of gnulib-tool in daemon/.

	build: fix build failure
	* bootstrap (gnulib_tool): Create lib and tests directories
	under daemon/ before running gnulib-tool there.

	daemon: use gnulib
	* daemon/Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Define.
	(AM_CPPFLAGS): Define, to include from gnulib's lib/
	(LDADD): Define, to link with gnulib's libgnu.a.
	* daemon/configure.ac: Use AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build-aux]),
	gl_EARLY and gl_INIT.
	(AC_CONFIG_FILES): Add lib/Makefile and tests/Makefile
	* daemon/m4/gnulib-cache.m4: New file, generated by running
	../.gnulib/gnulib-tool --import --with-tests hash
	* daemon/.gitignore: Ignore all of the imported files.
	build: tell bootstrap about daemon/
	* bootstrap: Run gnulib-tool --update in daemon/.
	Remove bootstrap's --gnulib-srcdir option, because it probably
	didn't work, and even if it did, we've discovered that using
	a separate git repo like that can lead to subtle mix-ups.

2009-08-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	appliance: Include more debug output in the /init script.
	Output more debugging information from this script, to enhance the
	usefulness of LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG output.

2009-08-06  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Recognise cd-rom devices in devsparts.c
	Also:
	* Un-duplicate device detection code by creating a common mapping function.
	* Add some more comments.

	Fix test failures in upload and download (RHBZ#515764)
	The tests hardcoded an MD5 of the test file, COPYING.LIB, whose contents had
	change. This change causes it to compute the MD5 rather than hardcoding it.

	OCaml provided by rjones.

2009-08-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add copyright and license notice to regressions/test-noexec-stack.pl

2009-08-05  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Add some newly-untracked files to .gitignore

	Fix swapon_label test
	The swapon label test has a side-effect, in that it creates a new partition.
	This causes the later failure of the list_partitions test.

	This change causes the swapon_label test to zero /dev/sdb after the test, and
	then re-read the partition table.

	Add resultant change to po/POTFILES.in
	I missed this when committing 7e9cb884492aec243337ffc8e4432a9ff2690956

	Add a test for an executable stack in resultant binaries

2009-08-03  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Cleanup whitespace warnings in Lib.pm

	Use grub entries to find Linux kernels
	This change adds grub parsing to Lib.pm. It adds the following structure to $os:
	  {boot}
	  ->{configs}
	    ->[0]
	      ->{title}   = "Fedora (2.6.29.6-213.fc11.i686.PAE)"
	      ->{kernel}  = \kernel
	      ->{cmdline} = "ro root=/dev/mapper/vg_mbooth-lv_root rhgb"
	      ->{initrd}  = \initrd
	  ->{default} = 0

	The kernel and initrd entries are just references to their top level entries
	under kernels and initrd_modules respectively.

	It also changes the way Linux kernels and initrd are discovered. Instead of
	searching /lib/modules and /boot for files with matching names, kernels and
	initrds are scanned as they are discovered in grub.conf.

	Additionally, the following attributes are added to the kernels top level entry:
	* path
	    The path to the kernel's vmlinuz file.
	* package
	    The name of the package which installed the kernel.

	The xml output of virt-inspector is updated to reflect all of the above changes.

2009-07-31  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	guestfish: Display RStructList results more pleasantly.

	Add interface to Linux 'inotify' API.

	lib: Add selinux=0 to default kernel command line.
	SELinux exists in a very disturbed state if it is enabled at
	boot time, but no policy is loaded.  In particular, it messes
	up the security.selinux extended attributes on files in a
	not-very-useful way.

	We can't enable SELinux because we don't know what policy
	can or should be loaded.  Therefore it's best to disable it
	completely.

2009-07-31  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Update incorrect comment in Lib.pm
	Related: change the name of the function the comment describes to be more
	accurate.

2009-07-31  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Improve warnings about missing tests.
	Don't warn where a command just has no tests.

	Instead check other commands' tests so we get a definitive
	(and much smaller) list of commands that are not tested anywhere.

	New commands: swapon-*, swapoff-*, mkswap-file.
	swapon-device
	swapoff-device
	swapon-file
	swapoff-file
	swapon-label
	swapoff-label
	swapon-uuid
	swapoff-uuid
	mkswap-file

	New command: 'fallocate' to (pre-)allocate sized files.

	New commands: 'ln', 'ln-f', 'ln-s', 'ln-sf' and 'readlink'.
	These commands can be used to make hard and symbolic links.  The
	readlink command is used to read existing symbolic links.

	Add 'realpath' command.

	Ignore failure of 'mv' commands in appliance Makefile.
	A lot of people report these as 'errors' when they are not.
	Hide the error messages.

	Subject: [PATCH] build: quote the other option test similarly

	* configure.ac: Quote properly.

	build: fix test for --nocompress option
	The test for febootstrap-to-initramfs' --nocompress option
	was always failing for me on F11.  Here's why:

	  $ bash                               ~/w/co/libguestfs:210-comment-fix
	  $ t=`febootstrap-to-initramfs 2>&1`
	  [Exit 1]
	  $ if ! echo $t|grep -sq -- --nocompress; then echo not found; fi
	  not found

	Notice: without quotes, the [--nocompress] term expands to "k",
	because I happen to have a temporary file named "k":

	  $ echo $t
	  Usage: febootstrap-to-initramfs [--files=filelist] k DIR Please read
	  febootstrap-to-initramfs(8) man page for more information.
	  $ echo "$t"
	  Usage: febootstrap-to-initramfs [--files=filelist] [--nocompress] DIR
	  Please read febootstrap-to-initramfs(8) man page for more information.

	a simpler example gives a clue:

	  $ touch a b c
	  $ echo [--z]
	  a b c
	  $ echo [--a]
	  a
	  $ echo [--b]
	  a b

	it's interpreting [--nocompress] as a range: "-" through "n", plus
	the other characters, ocmpres.  "k" falls in the --n range.

	Anyhow, here's the fix:

2009-07-29  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Whitespace and comment changes.

	df: Fix alignment of columns.

	guestfish: Make more strings translatable.
	However this doesn't yet attempt to translate the POD
	command documentation.  We need a plan to do that.

	tests: Use squashfs for static data where possible.
	Instead of creating a new InitBasicFS for just about every test,
	where a test doesn't need to write to the filesystem it is far
	faster to use prepared data on an InitSquashFS instead.

	This commit changes as many tests as possible to make this so,
	making the tests much faster.

	tests: Fix read_file test.
	The test ignored the fact that this function returns a (char *, size_t)
	pair, and just treated the char * as a string.  This of course would
	fail if the string didn't happen to be nul-terminated.

	The tests are updated to add a new TestOutputBuffer type which should
	be used with functions that return RBufferOut.

	Implement '*grep*' family of commands.

	Updated Polish translations (Piotr Drąg).

	Version 1.0.65.

	Updated PO files.

	(fully for Linux, partially for Windows).  It adds an architecture
	for each kernel detected, and an architecture for each root (ie.
	userspace) found.

	Lib.pm: Add file_architecture command.
	This command detects the architecture of some types of binaries,
	libraries, kernel modules and initrd images.

	Lib: Document the $ro parameter for mount_operating_system properly.

	Mention related tools in the manual page.

2009-07-28  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Whitespace: indent some names in images/Makefile.am correctly.

	Lib.pm: Use 'file' as replacement for 'zfile'.

	Pass '-z' parameter to 'file' command so it looks inside compressed files.
	Also we deprecate the old 'zfile' command.

	Add DeprecatedBy flag to mark functions which are deprecated.

	Need to declare asprintf_nowarn as inline to avoid gcc complaining.

	Version 1.0.63

2009-07-22  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add libguestfs-test-tool.
	This is an end-user testing tool, designed to test basic functionality
	of libguestfs/qemu/kernel combination on the end-user's final host
	machine.

	It does not perform a thorough test, but should be enough to find
	most booting issues.

	Also this is intended to be used when reporting bugs.

	Fix typo in error message.

	Revert "Add 'set-kernel'/'get-kernel'/LIBGUESTFS_KERNEL to override appliance kernel."
	This reverts commit 34d2df41626f1ee4172a6d40b06d72d6ed9d6348.

	set-append and set-kernel parameters are both nullable.
	(So are the return values, but leave that bug for another day).

	Add 'set-kernel'/'get-kernel'/LIBGUESTFS_KERNEL to override appliance kernel.

	Always pass:
	  noapic             (APIC causes problems for lots of people)
	  udevtimeout=300    (for very slow qemu using softemu)
	  acpi=off           (ACPI is troublesome and unnecessary, so turn it off)

	Allow TMPDIR to override directory used for temporary files (RHBZ#512905).

	Generator: Implement RBufferOut and "read-file" call.
	This commit implements the RBufferOut type for returning
	arbitrary 8 bit data from calls.

	We also implement the guestfs_read_file call to read a
	whole file that can contain any 8 bit content, but up to
	a limit of ~ 2 MB.

	Docs: Fully document the guestfs_readdir ftyp return field.

	Docs: Add "API Overview" section to guestfs(3) manpage.
	This section collects together related API calls, to provide
	more coherent documentation about different ways to carry
	out actions such as uploading and downloading.

	virt-inspector --ro-fish dom

	Both of the above commands give incorrect results if run on a

	$ virt-inspector --ro-fish RHEL54Betax64
	==> --ro -a RHEL54Betax64 -m /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00:/ -m /dev/sda1:/boot
	            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

	This is because the current code just prints back the original @ARGV
	parameters.

	This patch fixes this by getting the image names instead.

	Replace 'distrofamily' with feature tags
	It turns out that the distribution hierarchy is not as reliable concept as you
	might think. This patch removes distrofamily again.

	Instead of distrofamily, we will add feature tags. This patch adds 2 feature
	tags for Linux distributions:

	package_format (eg rpm/dpkg)
	package_management (eg rhn/yum/apt)

	This change is reflected in the output of virt-inspector

2009-07-18  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Make /sysroot path configurable.
	Currently /sysroot is hard-coded throughout the daemon code.

	This patch turns the path into a variable so that we can change
	it in future, for example to allow standalone mode to be implemented.

	This patch was tested by running all the C API tests successfully.

	RHEL 5.4 fix: Check for qemu-kvm binary in /usr/libexec

2009-07-17  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Differentiate 'distro' and 'distrofamily' in Sys::Guestfs::Lib
	Change distro in the output formally known as virt-inspector to reflect the
	actual distro. Possible values are now: fedora, rhel, centos, scientific,
	debian.

	Add new distrofamily entry which is one of: redhat, debian. Currently all
	distros except 'debian' are in the redhat family.

	This allows you to, for example, select a RHEL/CentOS/Scientific Linux specific
	kernel for installation rather than assuming they're all the same.

	Note this also changes the behaviour of virt-inspector --query. It will now only
	return rhel=yes for RHEL.

2009-07-17  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	cat: Example of finding DHCP IP address of a VM.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: Ignore perl/Makefile-pl.old

	Fix non-srcdir builds: further fixes to OCaml build rules.

2009-07-16  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Fixes for non-srcdir builds: Only include POTFILES from SUBDIRS directories.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: fix OCaml build rules.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: Files generated by configure should be in the tarball.

	Fix non-srcdir builds: Don't include generated *_protocol.c files in POTFILES.

	Don't clean up some non-generated files.

	Fix for non-srcdir builds: more misc fixes.

	Fix for non-srcdir builds: Run src/generator.ml from the srcdir.
	Note that files generated by src/generator.ml are stored in
	the srcdir, *not* the builddir.  The reason is so that they
	can be included in the tarball and will appear in the srcdir
	for tarball builds.

	More misc fixes to non-srcdir builds.

	More misc fixes for non-srcdir builds.

2009-07-15  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	New commands: 'mkmountpoint' and 'rmmountpoint'
	These specialized commands are used to create additional mountpoints
	before mounting filesystems.  They are only used where you want to
	mount several unrelated or read-only filesystems together, and need
	additional care to use correctly.

	Here is how to use these calls to unpack the "Russian doll" nest
	of a Fedora 11 live CD:

	 add-ro Fedora-11-i686-Live.iso
	 run
	 mkmountpoint /cd
	 mkmountpoint /squash
	 mkmountpoint /ext3
	 mount /dev/sda /cd
	 mount-loop /cd/LiveOS/squashfs.img /squash
	 mount-loop /squash/LiveOS/ext3fs.img /ext3

	The inner filesystem is now unpacked under the /ext3 mountpoint.

	New command: 'mountpoints' which returns a hash of device -> mountpoint.

2009-07-15  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Build fix: perl-libintl is not required for the basic Perl bindings.

	Version 1.0.61

	New tool virt-cat: display a file in a virtual machine.
	This script is just a simpler way to cat a file from a VM.  It
	is otherwise equivalent to using guestfish.

	 virt-cat someguest /etc/fstab

	 virt-cat someguest /var/log/messages | tail

	Make Perl strings translatable using perl-libintl.
	All Perl strings are now marked as translatable using __"string"
	or __x("string {placeholder}", placeholder => $_).  Perl strings
	now get copied to the PO files.

	The po/POTFILES.in file is now updated automagically whenever we
	add new *.c, *.pl or *.pm files into the repository.

	guestfish: Add tilde expansion for paths (RHBZ#511372).
	This commit adds tilde expansion for local users in guestfish:

	  ><fs> echo "~"
	  ~
	  ><fs> echo ~
	  /home/rjones
	  ><fs> echo ~foo
	  ~foo
	  ><fs> echo ~rjones/bar
	  /home/rjones/bar
	  ><fs> echo ~roo
	  ~roo
	  ><fs> echo ~root/foo
	  /root/foo
	  ><fs> echo ~root
	  /root

2009-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Version 1.0.60.

	java/Makefile.inc: Include this generated file.
	We have to include this generated file because it is part of
	the build system, thus required to exist before the generator
	runs.

	File missing from tarball: rc_protocol.x

	Version 1.0.59.

	RHEL 5: header was called <sys/xattr.h>

	Fix: daemon/xattr.c can now compile even when no xattr support.

2009-07-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Guestfish feature: remote control of guestfish over a pipe.
	The use case is to have a long-running guestfish process in
	a shell script, and thus to avoid the overhead of starting
	guestfish each time.  Do:

	 eval `guestfish --listen`

	 guestfish --remote somecmd
	 guestfish --remote someothercmd
	 guestfish --remote exit

	This patch also supports having multiple guestfish processes
	at the same time.

	The protocol is simple XDR messages over a Unix domain socket.

2009-07-14  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Removed getfattr/setfattr from TODO list, since now implemented.

	Support for Linux extended attributes.
	This commit adds six calls to support Linux extended attributes.
	They are:
	  getxattrs     list all extended attributes for a file or directory
	  setxattr      add/replace an extended attribute
	  removexattr   remove an extended attribute
	  lgetxattrs    \
	  lsetxattr     (same as above, but operate on symbolic links)
	  lremovexattr  /

	See attr(5) for more information.

	This also adds support for the FBuffer field type, which maps to
	an XDR opaque<> or a C (int, char *) pair.

2009-07-14  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	virt-inspector: Ignore swap partitions marked as "none".

	Improve launch error message.
	The previous error message was confusing for new users:

	  libguestfs: error: guestfs_mount: call launch() before using this function

	The new error message explains the action that the user must take,
	especially if they are using guestfish:

	  ><fs> mount /dev/sda1 /
	  libguestfs: error: guestfs_mount: call launch before using this function
	  (in guestfish, don't forget to use the 'run' command)

	Add reiserfs module to kernel whitelist.

2009-07-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Only allow virt-v2v to be run on single root guests (ie. no multi-boot).

	Ignore old-style initrd which is a compressed ext2 filesystem.
	'cpio' chokes on these, taking ages to decide that they are
	not cpio files, and producing masses of messages.  This was
	causing virt-inspector to be very slow (many minutes) on
	RHEL 3 guests.  With this fix, speed is back to normal.

	Implement new 'zfile' command, to show file type inside compressed files.

	Ignore java/Makefile.inc (generated file).

2009-07-13  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Automatically generate list of built java sources

	Revert "Fix checking of generator being run from the right directory."
	This reverts commit 35c646965a21d452cf74ef3683612210a653c36d.

	As well as reverting this change, add a comment explaining that
	configure must run first.

2009-07-13  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Move BUILT_SOURCES so the comment is back in the right place.

	Order alphabetically the options in guestfish.1 manpage.

2009-07-11  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish: implement -x option, echo commands before executing them.

	Fix: '-D' was not recognized as a parameter to guestfish.

	Regression test: Test reopening the handle in the same process.

	Guestfish: Add 'reopen' command to reopen the libguestfs handle.

	Add missing documentation for "more" command in guestfish help output.

	Add tests to many non-daemon functions.
	Tests are added to the following functions:
	  get_qemu get_path get_append get_autosync
	  is_ready is_config is_launching is_busy
	  set_memsize get_memsize get_pid

	Add TestOutputIntOp, CompareWithIntOp.
	These constructors allow enhanced tests where we compare
	the result of a test against some operator, eg. >= 1 or < 5

	Test for "version" command should be InitNone.

	Add comment to the code about InitNone and InitEmpty.
	These two constructors are treated as identical, but they
	should be distinct concepts.

	Fix UPDATES and host_cpu in configure.ac.
	UPDATES does not need to be propagated into config.h.

	host_cpu was AC_DEFINE'd twice.

2009-07-11  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Documentation for virt-v2v.

	V2V outline program.

2009-07-10  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Don't list Java files explicitly, since these files are auto-generated.

	Version 1.0.58.

	Proposal to add BufferIn and RBufferOut types (not implemented).

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib: Exit with error if a libvirt domain appears to have no disks.

	virt-df: Recognise libvirt domains with file-backed disks.
	File-backed disks (<source file="...">) didn't get recognised
	before.  This patch fixes the problem.

2009-07-10  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Add --version options to virt-df, virt-inspector and virt-v2v.

	Add 'version' call to get true library version number.
	This patch also changes the way that the version is specified
	in configure.ac.  It is now made out of four parts (major, minor,
	release and extra) and constructed for AC_INIT.

	Move 'use File::Temp' from virt-inspector program to Sys::Guestfs::Lib.

	Version 1.0.57.

	Update PO files.

	Additional C files for POTFILES.in.

	Rename internal subroutines with leading underscore character.
	Otherwise Pod::Coverage in the tests will complain that the
	internal subroutines are undocumented.

	Working version of virt-df.

	Fix for returning structures (hashes) from Perl calls.
	Calls such as stat and statvfs which returned a single structure
	were returning an array of values instead of a full hash of keys +
	values.

	Fix this by pushing the key names on the stack too.

	'$_' should be marked as a local variable in Sys::Guestfs::Lib::open_guest.

	Properly close fds and unregister handlers in guestfs_close.
	This caused a segfault if you tried to repeatedly open and close
	a guestfs handle in the same program.  The reason is that the
	old handler remained registered (not always - it was racey).

	This adds proper cleanup to the guestfs_close path, also for file
	descriptors.

	Added framework for 'virt-df' command.

	Ignore any file called 'localconfigure'.
	Developers should put their custom parameters for configure/autogen.sh
	into a script called ./localconfigure, and this script will be ignored
	by git and the build system.

	Added outline of the virt-v2v script.

2009-07-09  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Remove virt-inspector --force option - it didn't do anything.

	Sys::Guestfs::Lib minor documentation clean-up.

	Move the inspection analysis code into Sys::Guestfs::Lib library.
	Creates new functions:
	  inspect_all_partitions
	  inspect_partition
	  inspect_operating_systems
	  mount_operating_system
	  inspect_in_detail

	Includes far more documentation for the process.

	Move 'resolve_windows_path' to Sys::Guestfs::Lib.

	Move 'get_partitions' call into Sys::Guestfs::Lib.

	Add Sys::Guestfs::Lib - useful functions for using libguestfs from Perl.
	This adds an extra Perl module called Sys::Guestfs::Lib which
	adds useful functions for using libguestfs from Perl.

	The intention is that common code shared between virt-inspector,
	virt-df and virt-v2v will move into this library.

	This patch also changes virt-inspector to use this library.

	Just whitespace changes in the generator code.

2009-07-08  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Update with links to the new mailing list.

2009-07-07  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix checking of generator being run from the right directory.
	Originally it was looking for 'config.status', but this file
	might not exist until configure has been run.  Make it look for
	HACKING instead.

	Version 1.0.56.

2009-07-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	RHEL 5: Mount squashfs with explicit type.

	RHEL 5: Skip 'scrub' test if command is not in the initramfs.

	RHEL 5: 'mkswap -U' not supported, check before testing it.

	Update ocaml/.depend.

	RHEL 5: RHEL kernels don't have $arch at the end, so look for non-arch kernels too.

	RHEL 5: $(builddir) did not exist with this old autoconf/automake, so workaround.

	RHEL 5: for (int i = ...) is not permitted with this old version of GCC.

	Merge branch 'master' of git://git.et.redhat.com/libguestfs

2009-07-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Generate structs and struct lists generically.
	This modifies the way that struct and struct lists are generated
	(for return values) so that there is no need to add an explicit
	new type when adding a new structure.

	All tests pass, and the C API should be compatible.

	I have also inspected the changes that are made to the generated
	code by hand.

	Fix for 349814e9d912c4: Get correct path when building Ruby bindings.

2009-07-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Test two (of four) cancellation paths.

	Add a debug message to the library cancellation path.

	Introduce regression tests for various qemu failures.
	Test failure of qemu and recovery of the library:
	 - mid-command
	 - between commands
	 - during launch [test not working yet]
	 - explicitly killed by guestfs_kill_subprocess

	Also this patch cleans up the other tests in this directory
	and disables the long-winded test-bootbootboot test.

	guestfish: Always fflush stdout between commands.

	Whitespace change in ocaml/.depend file.

	Add 'get-pid' command.
	This is used to get the PID of the qemu subprocess, mainly for
	debugging and testing purposes.

	Todo: Remote-control guestfish through a pipe.

	Sort the .gitignore file (no semantic change).

	Remove files generated by autoreconf (Guido Gunter and Matthew Booth).

2009-07-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Don't die if reply message is oversized (RHBZ#509597).

2009-07-04  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	use 'stupid_simple' instead of 'nested' initramfs
	speeds up start of the appliance

	select proper kernel by architecture

2009-07-03  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make it possible to build in a separate directory
	This patch allows you to do:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure ...
	make

	This will output all generated files to the build directory. Given that
	autogen automatically runs configure, you can also do:

	BUILDDIR=./build ./autogen.sh

	which will do the right thing.

	Also:

	* Fix a dependency bug which means that guestfs_protocol.h
	  isn't automatically rebuilt.
	* Re-running autogen.sh with no arguments won't blow away your previous
	  configure arguments.

2009-07-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	generate slightly more "const-correct" code
	* src/generator.ml: Add a few "const" attributes.

	avoid leak upon failed realloc
	* daemon/guestfsd.c (commandrv): Free original buffer (rather
	than leaking it) if realloc fails.

	remove trailing blanks

	daemon/readdir: avoid a small leak
	* daemon/readdir.c (do_readdir): Free both p and v.name, in case
	only one of the allocations failed.

2009-07-03  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	touch fakeroot.log
	indicationg we're done creating the appliance

	remove superflous debirf scripts

2009-07-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish tab-completion on destination paths, fixed this time.
	Tab-completion on destination paths should now work correctly.

	Don't keep rebuilding debirf module symlinks.

	'readdir-and-stat' call is now effectively implemented.

	Add Debian appliance directory to the distfile.
	'make dist' won't copy symlinks into the output file, so we
	have to add a rule to the Makefile to copy these.

	(Issue reported by Guido Gunther).

2009-07-03  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://192.168.122.1/home/rjones/d/libguestfs

2009-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	use safe_malloc and safe_calloc in generated code
	* src/generator.ml (safe_malloc): Define to guestfs_safe_malloc.
	(safe_calloc): Define to guestfs_safe_calloc.
	[most generated code]: Fail immediately upon failure of otherwise-
	unchecked malloc and calloc calls.
	* src/guestfs.c: Include <stddef.h>.
	(xalloc_oversized): Define.
	* src/guestfs.h (guestfs_safe_calloc): Declare.

	prefer sizeof *VAR over sizeof TYPE (no semantic change)
	* src/generator.ml: Slightly safer, in case the
	declared type ever changes.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Prepare for 1.0.55.  PO files also updated.

	Add 'sfdiskM' command.
	This command is a saner interface to partitioning.

	All partition sizes are specified in megabytes (not cylinders).
	You don't need to specify the cyls/heads/secs parameters.

	All the test code has been updated to use this, so it is now
	CHS-independent (eg. when CHS changes as between IDE and virtio).

	Remove generated files guestfs_protocol.[ch].
	These generated files were accidentally left in when we
	removed the other generated files in cset
	b3cb0b04eb2d38ba32c160a83d8e3894b376907b.

	Don't rebuild the whole appliance if just the /init script has been changed.

	Improve virtio-blk performance (RHBZ#509383).

	Add ./configure --with-drive-if=(ide|scsi|virtio)
	With this flag the packager can decide to default to a particular
	qemu drive model.  The current default is 'ide', however note that
	we intend to change this in future to 'virtio' once some upstream
	regressions are fixed.  Packagers can force a particular drive
	model if they wish.

	Add the guestfish 'time' command.
	 ><fs> time sfdisk /dev/sda 0 0 0 ,
	 elapsed time: 6.12 seconds

	Add list of function_names to the daemon.
	Messages which include the proc_nr can now also include the
	name of the actual function being called.

	In verbose mode, daemon will display the time elapsed for each command.

	Ignore generated file appliance/debian/debirf.conf

2009-07-02  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Build Debian based appliance using debirf

	add debirf files

	unconditionally load dm module
	needed for device mapper (LVM)

	add missing module
	for modularized Debian kernels

2009-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	avoid automake failure
	* daemon/configure.ac: Use AM_PROG_CC_C_O, not AC_PROG_CC_C_O.

	arrange to build some generated sources
	* src/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Define.
	($(BUILT_SOURCES)): Depend on stamp-generator.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Re-add src/MAX_PROC_NR (generated file).
	This file is required by configure, so we need to add it so
	it is available after the git checkout.

	Memoize the output of pod2text function in the generator.
	This speeds up the generator greatly.

	Updated PO files.

	Remove generated code from git.
	Git users now require the OCaml compiler in order to regenerate
	the generated code after a checkout.

	Generated code will remain in the tarball, so users of the
	source tarball will not need the OCaml compiler.

	Generator now runs automatically when it has changed.

	Add 'readdir' call.
	This adds a readdir call (mostly intended for programs).  The
	return value is a list of guestfs_dirent structures.

	This adds the new types 'struct guestfs_dirent' and
	'struct guestfs_dirent_list', along with all the code to
	return these in the different language bindings.

	Also includes additional tests for OCaml and Perl bindings
	to test this.

2009-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	fish: handle some out-of-memory conditions
	* fish/destpaths.c (xalloc_oversized): Define.
	(complete_dest_paths_generator): Use size_t as type for a few
	variables, rather than int.
	Don't deref NULL or undef on failed heap alloc.
	Don't leak on failed realloc.
	Detect theoretical overflow when count_strings returns a very
	large number of strings.
	Handle asprintf failure.
	(APPEND_STRS_AND_FREE): Rewrite as do {...}while(0), so that each use
	can/must be followed by a semicolon.  Better for auto-formatters.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Call 'udevadm settle' after operations which add/remove device nodes.
	Because udev operates asynchronously, we found errors which were
	caused by a previous command (eg. sfdisk or pvremove) creating
	or removing a device, and that change not having happened by the
	time the next command was run.

	This patch adds calls to '/sbin/udevadm settle' after any commands
	which can add or remove device nodes.

	If udev is not being used or not available, this should have no
	effect.  The command fails and this is silently ignored.

	All instances of 'pclose' now check for return value != 0.
	We are generally interested that the subcommand ran without
	error, ie. had exit status of 0.  'pclose' returns the exit
	status, so we now check that pclose (fp) != 0.

	Fix error handling of external sfdisk command.
	Should use 'pclose' instead of 'fclose' (although fclose happens
	to work because of glibc internals).

	The result of pclose is the exit status of the command, so we
	need to test this is != 0.

	Generated code for the virtio_blk change.

	Change to use virtio_blk (virtio block device) by default.
	virtio_blk is the fast, virt-native block device driver
	supported by qemu and KVM.  Note that virtio_blk device
	names are called /dev/vd*.

	Existing scripts should continue working because device name
	translation will silently change device names of the form
	/dev/sd* to /dev/vd* as required.

	See also:
	http://libguestfs.org/guestfs.3.html#block_device_naming

2009-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't dereference or free undefined "msg" upon OOM.
	* src/guestfs.c (guestfs_error): Handle failing vasprintf.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add libguestfs(3) as an alias manpage for guestfs(3).

	Updated PO files.

	Reorder the environment variables alphabetically in the documentation.

	Document the $PAGER environment variable.

	Document the LIBGUESTFS_MEMSIZE environment variable.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change statvfs test so it doesn't depend on device size.
	Current statvfs test depended on a lot of filesystem details
	which can change if the CHS of the underlying block device
	changes (eg. with the switch from IDE -> virtio).  These are
	not really necessary to test the call, so instead just check
	for filesystem features.

	Clean up the output of the C API test code.
	Set output mode to unbuffered so that we see ordinary output
	messages and errors at the same time.

	Align "skipped" messages.

	Todo: getfattr, setfattr.

2009-06-30  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Whitelist kernel modules for hardware emulated by QEMU
	(Modified from Guido's original patch to use a wildcard to
	specify all virtio modules - RWMJ).

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for mknod, mkfifo, mknod_b, mknod_c, umask.

	New commands: mknod, mkfifo, mknod_b, mknod_c and umask.
	These commands are used to create block and char device
	nodes or FIFOs (named pipes) in the filesystem.

	The umask command is required also because the permissions
	used by mknod are masked by the umask.

	Also document and guarantee that the umask starts as 022.

	Use octal numbers for modes in the test suite.
	We have to use the OCaml convention (0o...).  Note that in
	OCaml 0777 is a _decimal_ number.  It'll catch you out.

	Generated code for 'set_memsize'/'get_memsize' calls.

	Add 'set_memsize'/'get_memsize' calls.
	Allow the qemu memory size to be specified either by API
	calls or by setting the LIBGUESTFS_MEMSIZE environment
	variable.

2009-06-30  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Use udev if available (Guido Gunter).
	Added support for Fedora's udev (Richard Jones).

	define REDHAT and DEBIAN
	so we can preprocess packagelist.in

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo: Suggest an environment variable for memsize configuration.

	Generated code for the 'mkswap*' commands.

	Implement 'mkswap', 'mkswap_L' and 'mkswap_U' commands.

	command makes one with a label.  The mkswap_U command makes one
	with a known UUID.

	Todo: Allow memsize to be configured.

	Todo: Investigations into 'binarch' command.

	Merge commit 'et/master'

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix for 'broken pipe' error when qemu dies (RHBZ#508713).

	Generated code for mount-loop command.

	Add mount-loop command (RHBZ#508668).
	Loop device mounts don't work for the generic 'mount' commands
	because the first parameter should be a file not a device.

	We want to separate out files parameters from device parameters
	in the long term, so this adds a new mount-loop command for this
	purpose.

	Fix memory leak in daemon/mount.c:do_mount_vfs.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Output the config filename containing a modprobe alias in XML
	This change affects the XML output:

	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/text() =>
	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/modulename/text()

	Additionally there are two new elements:

	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/augeas
	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/file

	These contain information about the location of the alias directive.
	/augeas is an augeas path. /file is the path of the file containing the
	directive.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo list: More suggestions.

	Generated code for 'initrd-list'.

	Add 'initrd-list' command to list contents of initrd images.
	Add 'initrd-list' command to list the files inside (new-style)
	initrd images.  Update virt-inspector to use this instead of
	the less efficient download/unpack locally method.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Add a comment to device naming heuristic

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for 'du' command.

	df and df-h commands can be used interactively to show disk
	space usage.

	Use existing statvfs command from programs.

	Todo: Removed suggestion for short form for pipes.

	Implement "more" and "less" commands in guestfish.
	Use commands such as:
	  more /etc/passwd
	  less /etc/fstab

	These commands are specific to guestfish.

	Todo list: Pipes now implemented, so remove from list.

	Generated code for head/tail commands.

	Implement "head", "head-n", "tail", "tail-n" commands.
	These commands let you view parts of a large file without
	passing the whole file over the network connection.

	Prevent 'n' being used as a parameter name.
	Parameters named 'n' sometimes break the Perl bindings, so
	check for this in the generator and prevent it.

	Generated code for 'wc_*' commands.

	Todo: wc command done.

	Implementation of 'wc_c', 'wc_w' and 'wc_l' commands.
	These commands count characters, words and lines in a file respectively.

	Implement TEST_ONLY environment variable to run selected tests only.
	To run just selected tests, do:
	  TEST_ONLY="hexdump mkfs" make -C capitests check

	Add large test files with standard content for the C API test.
	Large test files with standard content for the C API test, and
	add a regression test for previous hexdump failure on large files.

	Todo: RUN_ONLY_FOR

	Todo: 'wc' command.

	following 2 ways:

	* /operatingsystems/operatingsystem/os is renamed to
	  /operatingsystems/operatingsystem/name

	* /operatingsystems/kernels/version becomes an attribute of
	  /operatingsystems/kernel for consistency with initrds

2009-06-25  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	/etc/modprobe.conf
	/etc/modprobe.d/*

	Add yaml output for virt-inspector

	Make run-inspector-locally try to work out where it is installed
	This change means that you can run run-inspector-locally from any
	directory. You can also symlink to it and it'll do the right thing. This
	means you can put a symlink to run-inspectory-locally in your path
	called 'virt-inspector', and 'guestfish -i' will work.

2009-06-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add ABI guarantee to the documentation.

2009-06-23  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make the supermin helper look for any x86 kernel
	If you've got a non-PAE kernel installed on an i686 machine, the kernel
	architecture is i586. This change makes sure that supermin finds the
	installed kernel.

2009-06-04  Charles Duffy  <cduffy@messageone.com>

	Use --rbind rather than --bind for bind mounting /dev (to get /dev/pts).

	mount /dev via tmpfs before MAKEDEV invocation. This ensures that /dev can be bind-mounted when running commands, as initramfs cannot be bind-mounted.

2009-06-02  Charles Duffy  <cduffy@messageone.com>

	use add_drive_ro for --mount parameters from guestfish when called with --ro
	To prevent writes (such as ext3 journal replay) from occuring even when --ro is
	passed, guestfish should use add_drive_ro() for any drives specified on the
	command line with --add if --ro is also passed.

	As we need to look through the entire command line for --ro before adding any
	drives, we move the add process out of the argument-parsing loop and into its
	own function, patterned off mount_mps().

	build: don't tell "make clean" to remove my '~' backup files
	Hi Rich,

	automake's policy on what to remove via "make clean" is reasonable:
	if running build rules creates it, then "make clean" can and should remove it.
	However, even if build rules happen
	to create backup files, please remove only the specific ones
	they can create, not all of the ones in a directory.  Just in case
	someone relies on those and expect them to hang around...
