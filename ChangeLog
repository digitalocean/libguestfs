	RHEL 5: Mount squashfs with explicit type.

	RHEL 5: Skip 'scrub' test if command is not in the initramfs.

	RHEL 5: 'mkswap -U' not supported, check before testing it.

	Update ocaml/.depend.

	RHEL 5: RHEL kernels don't have $arch at the end, so look for non-arch kernels too.

	RHEL 5: $(builddir) did not exist with this old autoconf/automake, so workaround.

	RHEL 5: for (int i = ...) is not permitted with this old version of GCC.

	Merge branch 'master' of git://git.et.redhat.com/libguestfs

2009-07-07  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Generate structs and struct lists generically.
	This modifies the way that struct and struct lists are generated
	(for return values) so that there is no need to add an explicit
	new type when adding a new structure.

	All tests pass, and the C API should be compatible.

	I have also inspected the changes that are made to the generated
	code by hand.

	Fix for 349814e9d912c4: Get correct path when building Ruby bindings.

2009-07-06  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Test two (of four) cancellation paths.

	Add a debug message to the library cancellation path.

	Introduce regression tests for various qemu failures.
	Test failure of qemu and recovery of the library:
	 - mid-command
	 - between commands
	 - during launch [test not working yet]
	 - explicitly killed by guestfs_kill_subprocess

	Also this patch cleans up the other tests in this directory
	and disables the long-winded test-bootbootboot test.

	guestfish: Always fflush stdout between commands.

	Whitespace change in ocaml/.depend file.

	Add 'get-pid' command.
	This is used to get the PID of the qemu subprocess, mainly for
	debugging and testing purposes.

	Todo: Remote-control guestfish through a pipe.

	Sort the .gitignore file (no semantic change).

	Remove files generated by autoreconf (Guido Gunter and Matthew Booth).

2009-07-05  Richard Jones  <rjones@trick.home.annexia.org>

	Don't die if reply message is oversized (RHBZ#509597).

2009-07-04  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	use 'stupid_simple' instead of 'nested' initramfs
	speeds up start of the appliance

	select proper kernel by architecture

2009-07-03  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make it possible to build in a separate directory
	This patch allows you to do:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure ...
	make

	This will output all generated files to the build directory. Given that
	autogen automatically runs configure, you can also do:

	BUILDDIR=./build ./autogen.sh

	which will do the right thing.

	Also:

	* Fix a dependency bug which means that guestfs_protocol.h
	  isn't automatically rebuilt.
	* Re-running autogen.sh with no arguments won't blow away your previous
	  configure arguments.

2009-07-03  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	generate slightly more "const-correct" code
	* src/generator.ml: Add a few "const" attributes.

	avoid leak upon failed realloc
	* daemon/guestfsd.c (commandrv): Free original buffer (rather
	than leaking it) if realloc fails.

	remove trailing blanks

	daemon/readdir: avoid a small leak
	* daemon/readdir.c (do_readdir): Free both p and v.name, in case
	only one of the allocations failed.

2009-07-03  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	touch fakeroot.log
	indicationg we're done creating the appliance

	remove superflous debirf scripts

2009-07-03  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish tab-completion on destination paths, fixed this time.
	Tab-completion on destination paths should now work correctly.

	Don't keep rebuilding debirf module symlinks.

	'readdir-and-stat' call is now effectively implemented.

	Add Debian appliance directory to the distfile.
	'make dist' won't copy symlinks into the output file, so we
	have to add a rule to the Makefile to copy these.

	(Issue reported by Guido Gunther).

2009-07-03  Richard Jones  <rjones@centos5x32.home.annexia.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://192.168.122.1/home/rjones/d/libguestfs

2009-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	use safe_malloc and safe_calloc in generated code
	* src/generator.ml (safe_malloc): Define to guestfs_safe_malloc.
	(safe_calloc): Define to guestfs_safe_calloc.
	[most generated code]: Fail immediately upon failure of otherwise-
	unchecked malloc and calloc calls.
	* src/guestfs.c: Include <stddef.h>.
	(xalloc_oversized): Define.
	* src/guestfs.h (guestfs_safe_calloc): Declare.

	prefer sizeof *VAR over sizeof TYPE (no semantic change)
	* src/generator.ml: Slightly safer, in case the
	declared type ever changes.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Prepare for 1.0.55.  PO files also updated.

	Add 'sfdiskM' command.
	This command is a saner interface to partitioning.

	All partition sizes are specified in megabytes (not cylinders).
	You don't need to specify the cyls/heads/secs parameters.

	All the test code has been updated to use this, so it is now
	CHS-independent (eg. when CHS changes as between IDE and virtio).

	Remove generated files guestfs_protocol.[ch].
	These generated files were accidentally left in when we
	removed the other generated files in cset
	b3cb0b04eb2d38ba32c160a83d8e3894b376907b.

	Don't rebuild the whole appliance if just the /init script has been changed.

	Improve virtio-blk performance (RHBZ#509383).

	Add ./configure --with-drive-if=(ide|scsi|virtio)
	With this flag the packager can decide to default to a particular
	qemu drive model.  The current default is 'ide', however note that
	we intend to change this in future to 'virtio' once some upstream
	regressions are fixed.  Packagers can force a particular drive
	model if they wish.

	Add the guestfish 'time' command.
	 ><fs> time sfdisk /dev/sda 0 0 0 ,
	 elapsed time: 6.12 seconds

	Add list of function_names to the daemon.
	Messages which include the proc_nr can now also include the
	name of the actual function being called.

	In verbose mode, daemon will display the time elapsed for each command.

	Ignore generated file appliance/debian/debirf.conf

2009-07-02  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Build Debian based appliance using debirf

	add debirf files

	unconditionally load dm module
	needed for device mapper (LVM)

	add missing module
	for modularized Debian kernels

2009-07-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	avoid automake failure
	* daemon/configure.ac: Use AM_PROG_CC_C_O, not AC_PROG_CC_C_O.

	arrange to build some generated sources
	* src/Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES): Define.
	($(BUILT_SOURCES)): Depend on stamp-generator.

2009-07-02  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Re-add src/MAX_PROC_NR (generated file).
	This file is required by configure, so we need to add it so
	it is available after the git checkout.

	Memoize the output of pod2text function in the generator.
	This speeds up the generator greatly.

	Updated PO files.

	Remove generated code from git.
	Git users now require the OCaml compiler in order to regenerate
	the generated code after a checkout.

	Generated code will remain in the tarball, so users of the
	source tarball will not need the OCaml compiler.

	Generator now runs automatically when it has changed.

	Add 'readdir' call.
	This adds a readdir call (mostly intended for programs).  The
	return value is a list of guestfs_dirent structures.

	This adds the new types 'struct guestfs_dirent' and
	'struct guestfs_dirent_list', along with all the code to
	return these in the different language bindings.

	Also includes additional tests for OCaml and Perl bindings
	to test this.

2009-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	fish: handle some out-of-memory conditions
	* fish/destpaths.c (xalloc_oversized): Define.
	(complete_dest_paths_generator): Use size_t as type for a few
	variables, rather than int.
	Don't deref NULL or undef on failed heap alloc.
	Don't leak on failed realloc.
	Detect theoretical overflow when count_strings returns a very
	large number of strings.
	Handle asprintf failure.
	(APPEND_STRS_AND_FREE): Rewrite as do {...}while(0), so that each use
	can/must be followed by a semicolon.  Better for auto-formatters.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Call 'udevadm settle' after operations which add/remove device nodes.
	Because udev operates asynchronously, we found errors which were
	caused by a previous command (eg. sfdisk or pvremove) creating
	or removing a device, and that change not having happened by the
	time the next command was run.

	This patch adds calls to '/sbin/udevadm settle' after any commands
	which can add or remove device nodes.

	If udev is not being used or not available, this should have no
	effect.  The command fails and this is silently ignored.

	All instances of 'pclose' now check for return value != 0.
	We are generally interested that the subcommand ran without
	error, ie. had exit status of 0.  'pclose' returns the exit
	status, so we now check that pclose (fp) != 0.

	Fix error handling of external sfdisk command.
	Should use 'pclose' instead of 'fclose' (although fclose happens
	to work because of glibc internals).

	The result of pclose is the exit status of the command, so we
	need to test this is != 0.

	Generated code for the virtio_blk change.

	Change to use virtio_blk (virtio block device) by default.
	virtio_blk is the fast, virt-native block device driver
	supported by qemu and KVM.  Note that virtio_blk device
	names are called /dev/vd*.

	Existing scripts should continue working because device name
	translation will silently change device names of the form
	/dev/sd* to /dev/vd* as required.

	See also:
	http://libguestfs.org/guestfs.3.html#block_device_naming

2009-07-01  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	Don't dereference or free undefined "msg" upon OOM.
	* src/guestfs.c (guestfs_error): Handle failing vasprintf.

2009-07-01  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Add libguestfs(3) as an alias manpage for guestfs(3).

	Updated PO files.

	Reorder the environment variables alphabetically in the documentation.

	Document the $PAGER environment variable.

	Document the LIBGUESTFS_MEMSIZE environment variable.

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Change statvfs test so it doesn't depend on device size.
	Current statvfs test depended on a lot of filesystem details
	which can change if the CHS of the underlying block device
	changes (eg. with the switch from IDE -> virtio).  These are
	not really necessary to test the call, so instead just check
	for filesystem features.

	Clean up the output of the C API test code.
	Set output mode to unbuffered so that we see ordinary output
	messages and errors at the same time.

	Align "skipped" messages.

	Todo: getfattr, setfattr.

2009-06-30  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Whitelist kernel modules for hardware emulated by QEMU
	(Modified from Guido's original patch to use a wildcard to
	specify all virtio modules - RWMJ).

2009-06-30  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for mknod, mkfifo, mknod_b, mknod_c, umask.

	New commands: mknod, mkfifo, mknod_b, mknod_c and umask.
	These commands are used to create block and char device
	nodes or FIFOs (named pipes) in the filesystem.

	The umask command is required also because the permissions
	used by mknod are masked by the umask.

	Also document and guarantee that the umask starts as 022.

	Use octal numbers for modes in the test suite.
	We have to use the OCaml convention (0o...).  Note that in
	OCaml 0777 is a _decimal_ number.  It'll catch you out.

	Generated code for 'set_memsize'/'get_memsize' calls.

	Add 'set_memsize'/'get_memsize' calls.
	Allow the qemu memory size to be specified either by API
	calls or by setting the LIBGUESTFS_MEMSIZE environment
	variable.

2009-06-30  Guido Günther  <agx@sigxcpu.org>

	Use udev if available (Guido Gunter).
	Added support for Fedora's udev (Richard Jones).

	define REDHAT and DEBIAN
	so we can preprocess packagelist.in

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo: Suggest an environment variable for memsize configuration.

	Generated code for the 'mkswap*' commands.

	Implement 'mkswap', 'mkswap_L' and 'mkswap_U' commands.
	These commands are used to make Linux swap devices.  The mkswap_L
	command makes one with a label.  The mkswap_U command makes one
	with a known UUID.

	Todo: Allow memsize to be configured.

	Todo: Investigations into 'binarch' command.

	Rearrange guestfish commands in the manpage.

	Add missing documentation for new 'more' and 'less' commands in guestfish.

	Version 1.0.54

	Check for XML::Writer dependency for virt-inspector.

	Remove generated files in make clean.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Merge commit 'et/master'

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Fix for 'broken pipe' error when qemu dies (RHBZ#508713).

	Generated code for mount-loop command.

	Add mount-loop command (RHBZ#508668).
	Loop device mounts don't work for the generic 'mount' commands
	because the first parameter should be a file not a device.

	We want to separate out files parameters from device parameters
	in the long term, so this adds a new mount-loop command for this
	purpose.

	Fix memory leak in daemon/mount.c:do_mount_vfs.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Output the config filename containing a modprobe alias in XML
	This change affects the XML output:

	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/text() =>
	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/modulename/text()

	Additionally there are two new elements:

	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/augeas
	/operatingsystems/operatingsystem/modprobealiases/alias/file

	These contain information about the location of the alias directive.
	/augeas is an augeas path. /file is the path of the file containing the
	directive.

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Todo list: More suggestions.

	Generated code for 'initrd-list'.

	Add 'initrd-list' command to list contents of initrd images.
	Add 'initrd-list' command to list the files inside (new-style)
	initrd images.  Update virt-inspector to use this instead of
	the less efficient download/unpack locally method.

2009-06-29  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Add a comment to device naming heuristic

2009-06-29  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Generated code for 'du' command.

	Added 'du' command.
	This command estimates file usage for files and directories.

	Generated code for df / df-h.

	Add 'df' and 'df-h' commands.
	df and df-h commands can be used interactively to show disk
	space usage.

	Use existing statvfs command from programs.

	Todo: Removed suggestion for short form for pipes.

	Implement "more" and "less" commands in guestfish.
	Use commands such as:
	  more /etc/passwd
	  less /etc/fstab

	These commands are specific to guestfish.

	Todo list: Pipes now implemented, so remove from list.

	Generated code for head/tail commands.

	Implement "head", "head-n", "tail", "tail-n" commands.
	These commands let you view parts of a large file without
	passing the whole file over the network connection.

	Prevent 'n' being used as a parameter name.
	Parameters named 'n' sometimes break the Perl bindings, so
	check for this in the generator and prevent it.

	Generated code for 'wc_*' commands.

	Todo: wc command done.

	Implementation of 'wc_c', 'wc_w' and 'wc_l' commands.
	These commands count characters, words and lines in a file respectively.

	Implement TEST_ONLY environment variable to run selected tests only.
	To run just selected tests, do:
	  TEST_ONLY="hexdump mkfs" make -C capitests check

	Add large test files with standard content for the C API test.
	Large test files with standard content for the C API test, and
	add a regression test for previous hexdump failure on large files.

	Todo: RUN_ONLY_FOR

	Todo: 'wc' command.

2009-06-28  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Guestfish pipes.

	Haskell bindings: Implement bindtests.

	Haskell bindings: Int and Int64 return types.

	Merge branch 'master' of git+ssh://g-rjones@et.redhat.com/git/libguestfs

	Haskell bindings: fix boolean arguments.

	Haskell bindings: Fix integer arguments.

2009-06-27  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Clean up XML output
	This change makes XML use XML::Writer, and modifies the output in the
	following 2 ways:

	* /operatingsystems/operatingsystem/os is renamed to
	  /operatingsystems/operatingsystem/name

	* /operatingsystems/kernels/version becomes an attribute of
	  /operatingsystems/kernel for consistency with initrds

2009-06-25  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make virt-inspector look in more places for module aliases
	Specifically:
	/etc/conf.modules
	/etc/modules.conf
	/etc/modprobe.conf
	/etc/modprobe.d/*

	Add yaml output for virt-inspector

	Make run-inspector-locally try to work out where it is installed
	This change means that you can run run-inspector-locally from any
	directory. You can also symlink to it and it'll do the right thing. This
	means you can put a symlink to run-inspectory-locally in your path
	called 'virt-inspector', and 'guestfish -i' will work.

2009-06-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	More TODO items for future work.

	Allow guestfish -i / virt-inspector on live domains, in limited circumstances.

	Fix dependencies in perl so it doesn't always rebuild

2009-06-24  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement guestfish -f option to allow guestfish scripts.
	New '-f' option allows scripts to be written using:
	 #!/usr/bin/guestfish -f

	Incorrect assignment on glob error path.

	Todo items: guestfish options -i and -f.

2009-06-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Implement libtool library versioning.
	Use maximum proc_nr (MAX_PROC_NR) as a surrogate for the
	library ABI version, resulting in version numbers such as
	libguestfs.so.0.<MAX_PROC_NR>.0 for the final library.

	Add ABI guarantee to the documentation.

2009-06-23  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Make the supermin helper look for any x86 kernel
	If you've got a non-PAE kernel installed on an i686 machine, the kernel
	architecture is i586. This change makes sure that supermin finds the
	installed kernel.

2009-06-23  Richard W.M. Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Use --rbind rather than --bind for bind mounting /dev (to get /dev/pts).

	mount /dev via tmpfs before MAKEDEV invocation. This ensures that /dev can be bind-mounted when running commands, as initramfs cannot be bind-mounted.

2009-06-02  Charles Duffy  <cduffy@messageone.com>

	use add_drive_ro for --mount parameters from guestfish when called with --ro
	To prevent writes (such as ext3 journal replay) from occuring even when --ro is
	passed, guestfish should use add_drive_ro() for any drives specified on the
	command line with --add if --ro is also passed.

	As we need to look through the entire command line for --ro before adding any
	drives, we move the add process out of the argument-parsing loop and into its
	own function, patterned off mount_mps().

	build: don't tell "make clean" to remove my '~' backup files
	Hi Rich,

	automake's policy on what to remove via "make clean" is reasonable:
	if running build rules creates it, then "make clean" can and should remove it.
	However, even if build rules happen
	to create backup files, please remove only the specific ones
	they can create, not all of the ones in a directory.  Just in case
	someone relies on those and expect them to hang around...
