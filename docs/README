This directory contains miscellaneous manual pages which don't fit
elsewhere.

Most libguestfs documentation is in manual pages.  The source for
those manual pages are POD files (*.pod), and they are normally
located next to the source files they relate to (eg. guestfish
documentation is in fish/guestfish.pod).

All manual pages are available online at http://libguestfs.org/

The main API documentation is: http://libguestfs.org/guestfs.3.html
