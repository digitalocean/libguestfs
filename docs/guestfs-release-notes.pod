=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.32

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.30.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 New tools

The new L<virt-v2v-copy-to-local(1)> tool is an ancillary tool for
L<virt-v2v(1)> allowing you to convert source guests that virt-v2v is
unable to access directly.

=head3 New features in existing tools

Virt-customize knows how to write a random seed to CirrOS (Pino Toscano).

On Fedora, virt-customize runs L<dnf(8)> with the I<--best> flag,
ensuring it always updates to the latest available packages.

Virt-builder now provides 32 bit Fedora templates.

Virt-builder and virt-customize I<--install> option now works on 32
bit Fedora guests.  Previously it would try to install 64 bit
packages (Jan Sedlák).

Virt-builder can now fetch cloud images using Simple Streams v1.0
metadata (Pino Toscano).

Virt-builder can now fetch openSUSE cloud images out of the box
(Cédric Bosdonnat).

Virt-customize will now use stronger (SHA-512) encrypted passwords by
default on openSUSE E<ge> 11 (Pino Toscano).

Virt-builder will now correctly handle output filenames containing
colon characters (C<:>), and will create temporary files in the
libguestfs cache directory instead of defaulting to F</tmp>
(Pino Toscano).

Virt-resize has a new I<--unknown-filesystems> option to control what
to do when asked to resize a filesystem that libguestfs doesn't know
how to resize.

Virt-v2v now has an I<--in-place> flag/mode, allowing in-place
conversion of guests (Roman Kagan).

Virt-v2v has a I<--compressed> option for creating compressed qcow2
output files.

Virt-v2v can now correctly get the VMware datacenter path (dcPath)
from libvirt, instead of having to calculate it using an algorithm
that occasionally got the wrong answer (Matthias Bolte, Tingting
Zheng).

Virt-v2v now processes RAM sizes correctly for 64 bit guests when
running on a 32 bit host.

=head3 Language bindings

In Perl and Python programs, the C<get_program_name> API now returns
the true program name, instead of the incorrect string C<perl> or
C<python>.

The Python bindings can now be compiled against a different version of
libguestfs, allowing the pip module to be built against any version of
libguestfs (instead of requiring the pip module and libguestfs to have
exactly the same version).

The quality of the Ruby rdoc (documentation) has been improved (Pino
Toscano).

Perl scripts no longer hard-code the location of perl in the shebang
line, but use L<env(1)> to locate it instead (Pino Toscano).

In OCaml programs, the guestfs handle was incorrectly made into a
global root, meaning it could never be garbage collected.  If you
didn't call the C<close> function explicitly, the handle would not be
closed until the whole program exited.  This has now been fixed so
handles will be garbage collected in the usual way.  This changes the
API of the OCaml function C<Guestfs.event_callback>.  Note that non-C
language bindings are not covered by the libguestfs API/ABI guarantee,
although we try hard not to change them, but in this case it was
essential in order to fix this very serious bug.

=head3 Inspection

Alpine Linux and the APK package manager, ALT Linux, Frugalware, and
PLD Linux are now recognized (Pino Toscano).

If it exists, F</etc/os-release> will be preferred for inspecting
Linux guests (Pino Toscano).

The correct kernel version is returned for Windows guests E<ge> 10.

=head3 Documentation

The large L<guestfs(3)> man page has been split into several separate
man pages: L<guestfs-hacking(1)> L<guestfs-internals(1)>
L<guestfs-security(1)>.  In the source tree, a new F<docs> directory
contains this documentation.

=head3 Architectures and platforms

Libguestfs now supports ARM 64 bit platforms with vGICv3.

=head2 Security

See also L<guestfs-security(1)>.

=over 4

=item C<CVE-2015-5745>

L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1251157>

This is not a vulnerability in libguestfs, but because we always give
a virtio-serial port to each guest (since that is how guest-host
communication happens), an escalation from the appliance to the host
qemu process is possible.  This could affect you if:

=over 4

=item *

your libguestfs program runs untrusted programs out of the guest
(using L</guestfs_sh> etc), or

=item *

another exploit was found in (for example) kernel filesystem code that
allowed a malformed filesystem to take over the appliance.

=back

If you use sVirt to confine qemu, that would thwart some attacks.

=item Virt-customize permissions on F<.ssh>, F<.ssh/authorized_keys>

L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1260778>.

Previously when asked to inject an SSH key into a guest,
virt-customize (hence virt-builder too) would create the F<.ssh>
directory and F<.ssh/authorized_keys> file with too broad permissions,
allowing other users to read.  They are now created as C<0700> and
C<0600> respectively, which is the same as the L<ssh-copy-id(1)>
utility.

=back

=head2 API

=head3 New APIs

=over 4

=item C<guestfs_get_identifier>

=item C<guestfs_set_identifier>

Get/set a per-handle identifier.  The main effect of this is to
change trace output from:

 libguestfs: trace: foo

to:

 libguestfs: trace: ID: foo

making it easier to follow traces in multi-threaded programs, or where
a program uses multiple handles (especially virt-v2v).

=item C<guestfs_vfs_minimum_size>

Return the minimum size of a filesystem (when shrunk).  This supports
ext2/3/4, XFS and btrfs, and can support other filesystem types in
future (Maxim Perevedentsev).

=back

=head3 Other API changes

=over 4

=item C<guestfs_disk_create>: add C<preallocation> = C<off>/C<metadata>/C<full>.

For raw, this allows C<off> as a synonym for C<sparse> (making it
consistent with qcow2).  For qcow2, this allows C<sparse> as a synonym
for C<off>.

It also adds C<full>, which corresponds to fully allocated, but uses
L<posix_fallocate(3)> for efficiency.

=item C<guestfs_tar_in>: new C<xattrs>, C<selinux>, C<acl> parameters.

=item C<guestfs_tar_out>: new C<xattrs>, C<selinux>, C<acl> parameters.

These extra parameters control whether extended attributes, SELinux
contexts and/or POSIX ACLs are restored from / saved to tarballs.

=item C<guestfs_add_drive>

The existing C<username> and C<secret> parameters can be used to
supply authentication for iSCSI (Pino Toscano).

=back

=head2 Build changes

The C<./configure --enable-valgrind-daemon> option has been removed.

You can no longer build libguestfs on RHEL 5-era (c.2007) machines.
See the C<oldlinux> branch if you need (limited) RHEL 5 support.

Virt-p2v can now be built on RHEL 6-era (c.2010) Linux distros.

OCaml E<ge> 3.11 (released in 2008) is now required to build from git.

Building the Perl bindings now requires C<Module::Build> (instead of
C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>).

Builds should be faster (especially when incrementally rebuilding),
because work was done to reduce build times.

Both OCaml and the OCaml findlib module are required if you need to
run the generator at build time.  Previously the build would have
failed if findlib was not installed.

C<make check> tests now run in parallel (within each test directory).

C<make install> no longer installs OCaml F<bindtests.*> files
incorrectly.

C<make install> can now be run twice.  Previously it would fail on the
second run.

C<make clean> should now remove nearly every file that C<make>
creates.

A new C<make installcheck> rule has been added, allowing the installed
copy of libguestfs to be tested.

=head2 Internals

Some effort was put into minimizing the size of the appliance, which
reduces temporary disk space and time needed by libguestfs handles.

The appliance now passes the NIC name to dhcpd, fixing hangs when
running the appliance on some distros (Cédric Bosdonnat).

OCaml C<Guestfs.Errno> is now generated (Pino Toscano).

In OCaml tools, common code now handles I<--debug-gc>, I<--verbose>
and other common options (Roman Kagan, Pino Toscano).

The virt-v2v test harness allows us to boot the test guests at fixed
dates in the past, ensuring that Windows reactivation doesn't kick in.

There is a new internal API for reading/writing a subprocess via a
pipe from library code.

Used C<deheader> program to remove unused C<#include> directives.

In OCaml tools, the C<Char> and C<String> modules now implicitly
reference the C<Common_utils.Char> and C<Common_utils.String> modules
(instead of the ones from stdlib).  The C<Common_utils> modules
contain a number of extra char/string utility functions, and also hide
some unsafe functions in stdlib.

Many more virt-v2v tests will now be run even if you don't have
rhsrvany and virtio-win installed (Roman Kagan).

The huge F<configure.ac> file has been split into several smaller
files called F<m4/guestfs_*.m4>.

The old F<tests/data> and F<tests/guests> directories have been moved
to F<test-data/>.  This new top level directory carries all test data
which is common, large and/or shared between multiple tests.

There is a new top level F<website/> directory containing the public
L<http://libguestfs.org> website (or most of it).

The fuzz testing of inspection (F<tests/fuzz>) has been removed.

Virt-p2v now saves the source physical machine dmesg output into the
conversion server debug directory, making it simpler to debug cases of
missing drivers, firmware etc.

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.30

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.28.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 New tools

L<virt-dib(1)> is a secure and safe alternative to the OpenStack
"diskimage-builder" tool.  It is compatible with diskimage-builder
elements.  (Pino Toscano)

L<virt-get-kernel(1)> extracts the kernel and ramdisk from a disk
image.  Previously this functionality was part of L<virt-builder(1)>,
but the new tool is more featureful.  (Pino Toscano)

=head3 New features in existing tools

L<virt-v2v(1)> I<-i ova> mode can now read a wider range of OVA files,
and also unpacked files (directories).

virt-v2v now securely passes options to curl, so passwords, cookies
and so on cannot be seen by users with shell access on the same
machine.

virt-v2v has a new I<--password-file> option to allow you to securely
pass in a password, and to avoid an interactive prompt.

virt-v2v disables Windows autoreboot, making debugging conversion
failures on Windows easier.

virt-v2v now comes with an extensive external test suite.
See L<virt-v2v-test-harness(1)>.

virt-v2v allows virtio drivers to come from any location (Roman
Kagan), and drivers can be read directly from the virtio ISO.

virt-v2v supports conversion of Windows E<ge> 8.  Note this is
experimental, and possibly broken.  Use with caution.

virt-v2v can now convert UEFI guests.

L<virt-p2v(1)> adds a network configuration dialog.

virt-p2v now has C<p2v.pre>, C<p2v.post> and C<p2v.fail> triggers,
allowing arbitrary scripts for preparing the host for conversion and
tidying up post-conversion.

virt-p2v now uses the more advanced metacity window manager
(instead of matchbox).

L<virt-sysprep(1)> will remove C</var/spool/mail/username> for
non-root accounts (Hu Tao).

L<virt-customize(1)>, L<virt-builder(1)> and virt-sysprep have the
following new options:

=over 4

=item I<--commands-from-file>

allow long lists of commands to be read from a file instead of from
the command line (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--copy>

copy files inside the guest (Maros Zatko)

=item I<--copy-in>

copy host files recursively into the guest (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--move>

move files inside the guest (Maros Zatko)

=item I<--ssh-inject>

inject SSH keys into a guest (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--sm-attach>

=item I<--sm-credentials>

=item I<--sm-register>

=item I<--sm-remove>

=item I<--sm-unregister>

register and unregister a guest from subscription-manager
(Pino Toscano)

=item I<--touch>

touch a file in the guest (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--truncate>

=item I<--truncate-recursive>

truncate files (Maros Zatko)

=back

Improvements to virt-customize firstboot support.  In particular,
Windows firstboot should work as well as Linux (Roman Kagan).

L<virt-df(1)> can now use PolicyKit, SASL and other authentication
methods when getting the list of domains from libvirt.

Improvements to guestfish bash completion (Pino Toscano).

Bash completion now completes short options as well as long options
(Pino Toscano).

L<guestfish(1)> now displays a command synopsis if the number of
parameters given to a command is wrong (Hu Tao).

virt-builder now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions back to RHEL 3.

virt-builder supports SUSE guests using zypper (Cédric Bosdonnat).

=head3 Language bindings

The Java bindings now include validated Javadoc, and other improvements
(Pino Toscano).

Multiple fixes and improvements to the PHP bindings (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Inspection

Inspection can now get icons from RHEL 7 and CentOS 7.

F</etc/favicon.png> is now allowed to be a symbolic link.

For RPM-based guests, inspection now returns RPM Epoch fields.

Debian packages now have separate Epoch and Version fields
(Nikos Skalkotos).

OpenBSD detection added, FreeBSD and NetBSD added as separate
"distros", and other BSD inspection improvements and bug fixes
(Nikos Skalkotos).

CoreOS detection added (Nikos Skalkotos).

The package manager in Fedora E<ge> 22 is C<dnf>.

ReactOS guests can be inspected (Maros Zatko).

Add support for UEFI guests.

Inspection now works when kernel modules are gzip or xz compressed
(Pino Toscano).

Inspection now recognizes ppc64 and ppc64le guests (Maros Zatko).

Inspection lists the installed applications on Archlinux guests
(Nikos Skalkotos).

=head3 Architectures and platforms

PPC64 (POWER7) and PPC64LE (POWER8) architectures are now much better
supported, and should work out of the box.

For aarch64, we use AAVMF (an open source UEFI implementation based on
OVMF) if available to run the appliance.

For armv7, we now use the I<-M virt> machine type by default.

There is better support for compiling on non-Linux platforms
(Pino Toscano, Margaret Lewicka).

Libguestfs should now work on MIPS 32 bit little endian ("mipsel").  I
have not been able to try 64 bit or big endian.

=head2 Security

=over 4

=item CVE-2014-8484

=item CVE-2014-8485

Libguestfs previously ran the L<strings(1)> utility on untrusted
files.  Strings could parse BFD headers in an unsafe way, leading to
possible arbitrary code execution.  Libguestfs now runs strings with a
flag to ensure it does not try to parse BFD headers.  This could have
led to exploitation of the libguestfs appliance, but since libguestfs
further constrains the appliance through virtualization, SELinux and
other techniques, it was unlikely to have caused any privilege
escalation on the host.

=item XPath injection in virt-v2v

One possible XPath injection vulnerability was fixed in virt-v2v.
This might have allowed a malicious guest which was being converted by
virt-v2v to construct an arbitrary XPath expression which would have
been evaluated on the host (by the libxml2 library linked to the
virt-v2v binary).  It is not clear what the effects of this might be.

For further information, see upstream commit
L<https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commit/6c6ce85f94c36803fe2db35a98db436bff0c14b0>

=item Denial of service problems when using C<qemu-img info>

When using the American Fuzzy Lop fuzzer (C<afl-fuzz>) on the
C<qemu-img info> command, Richard W.M. Jones found that certain files
can cause the C<qemu-img> program to use lots of memory and time (for
example 6GB of heap and 14 seconds of CPU time on a fast Intel
processor), and in some cases to crash.  Since libguestfs may run
C<qemu-img info> on disk images to find out what they contain, this
transitively could cause libguestfs to hang or consume lots of memory.

Libguestfs was modified so that it uses resource limits to limit the
space and time used by C<qemu-img info>, to avoid this problem.  If a
malicious user tries to pass one of these disk images to libguestfs,
C<qemu-img> will crash and the crash is reported back to libguestfs
callers as an error message.

=item C<qgroupid>

for adding the snapshot to a qgroup

=back

C<guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_create> can also take the optional
C<qgroupid> parameter (Hu Tao).

C<guestfs_set_uuid> can set UUID of swap partitions, Btrfs
(Hu Tao, Chen Hanxiao).

C<guestfs_copy_device_to_file> and C<guestfs_copy_file_to_file> have a
new optional C<append> parameter, allowing you to append to the output
file instead of truncating it.

C<guestfs_mkfs> has a new optional C<label> parameter to set the
initial label of the new filesystem (Pino Toscano).

C<guestfs_set_label> and C<guestfs_set_uuid> now set C<ENOTSUP> as errno
when there is no implemented support for the filesystem of the specified
mountable (Chen Hanxiao).

Environment variables now let you write C<LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=true>,
C<LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=0> and so on.

All C<guestfs_sfdisk*> APIs have been deprecated.  Because
L<sfdisk(8)> was rewritten, incompatibly, upstream, we don't recommend
using these APIs in future code.  Use the C<guestfs_part*> APIs as
replacements.

APIs such as C<guestfs_download> do not truncate F</dev/stdout> or
F</dev/stderr> when writing to them, meaning that if you redirect
stdout or stderr to a file, the file is no longer truncated.





=head2 Build changes

The daemon no longer uses its own separate copy of gnulib.  Instead it
shares a single copy with the library.

OCaml F<.annot> files are now created, so IDEs and editors like emacs
and vi can browse OCaml types in the source code.

Various fixes to allow different host/appliance architecture builds
(Pino Toscano).

Automake is now used directly to build all the OCaml programs, instead
of ad hoc Makefile rules.  One side effect of this is to enable
warnings in all the C code used by OCaml programs.

C<-fno-strict-overflow> is used throughout the build to avoid dubious
GCC optimizations.

Multiple cleanups to support GCC 5.

OCaml OUnit2 is needed to run some OCaml tests.

Creating a statically linked F<libguestfs.a> should work again.

The F<src/api-support> subdirectory and its scripts are no longer
used.  Instead we store in the F<generator/actions.ml> when the API
was added to libguestfs.

=head2 Internationalization

The translation service has changed from Transifex to Zanata.

Many more translations are available now, for both library and tools
messages and documentation.

=head2 Internals

In all OCaml tools, there are now common C<error>, C<warning>, C<info>
functions, and common way to set and get the I<--quiet>, I<-x> (trace)
and I<-v> (verbose) flags, and colour highlighting used consistently.

C<COMPILE_REGEXP> macros are used to simplify PCRE constructors and
destructors.

In the generator, C<Pointer> arguments have finally been implemented.

Internal identifiers no longer use double and triple underscores
(eg. C<guestfs___program_name>).  These identifiers are invalid for
C99 and C++ programs, although compilers would accept them.

The daemon no longer parses C<guestfs_*> options from
F</proc/cmdline>.  Instead it only takes ordinary command line
options.  The appliance init script turns F</proc/cmdline> into daemon
command line options.

The tests can now run the daemon as a "captive process", allowing it
to be run directly on the host.  The main advantage of this is we can
run valgrind directly on the daemon during testing.

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.28

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.26.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 Tools

L<virt-v2v(1)> and L<virt-p2v(1)> are tools for converting from
foreign hypervisors (such as VMware or Xen) or physical machines, to
KVM.  These tools were previously a separate project.  The code for
both tools has been integrated into the libguestfs tree.  As part of
the refactoring, virt-p2v has been rewritten (from Ruby, now C), and
virt-v2v now uses several modern features of qemu which make it run
many times faster than before.  L<virt-v2v(1)> can import from: VMware
vCenter, VMware OVA files, local disk files, libvirt, RHEL 5 Xen.  It
can output to: oVirt or Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV-M),
OpenStack Glance, libvirt, qemu, local disk files.

L<virt-log(1)> is a new tool for listing log files from guests.  It
supports a variety of guests including Linux traditional, Linux using
journal, and Windows event log.

L<virt-builder(1)> has a new C<--machine-readable> option to make it
simpler to consume virt-builder from other programs.

New L<virt-builder(1)> and L<virt-customize(1)> I<--chmod> option.

L<virt-sysprep(1)> will now remove: systemd journals, anaconda logs,
lightdm logs, debian-installer files, apt logs, exim logs, ConsoleKit
logs, firewalld logs, grubby logs, proftpd logs, libvirt/libxml logs,
and several other log files.  The virt-sysprep C<user-account>
operation is now able to remove or keep particular user accounts.
(Pino Toscano).

New L<guestmount(1)> I<--fd> option, allowing you to run guestmount
captive under another process.

L<virt-sparsify(1)> has a new I<--tmp> option allowing you to
precisely control where temporary files are stored.

L<virt-sparsify(1)> can now write to a block device.

L<virt-customize(1)> and L<virt-sysprep(1)> now support adding
firstboot scripts to Windows guests.

L<virt-cat(1)>, L<virt-edit(1)>, L<virt-ls(1)> now support the I<-m>
option, allowing you to override automatic inspection of guests and
instead specify where to mount partitions (Pino Toscano).

The virt tools now have coloured output: green for OK, red for errors,
blue for warnings.

=head3 Language bindings

You can build a Python distribution using C<make -C python sdist>

Ruby bindings have switched from C<Test::Unit> to C<MiniTest>.

The Java bindings are now compatible with OpenJDK 8 (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Inspection

Oracle Linux is returned as C<oraclelinux> (Nikos Skalkotos).

Linux guests which do not have F</etc/fstab> can now be handled
(Pino Toscano).

Minix is returned as C<minix> (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Architectures

Aarch64 (64 bit ARM) support has been added.

Inspection and the C<guestfs_file_architecture> call can now recognize
arm (32 bit) and aarch64 guests.

=head2 Security

=over 4

=item CVE-2014-0191 Network usage and entity resolution in XML parsing

Libguestfs previously used unsafe libxml2 APIs for parsing libvirt
XML.  These APIs defaulted to allowing network connections to be made
when certain XML documents were presented.  Using a malformed XML
document it was also possible to exhaust all CPU, memory or file
descriptors on the machine.

Since the libvirt XML comes from a trusted source (the libvirt daemon)
it is not thought that this could have been exploitable.

This was fixed in libguestfs E<ge> 1.27.9 and the fix was backported
to stable versions E<ge> 1.26.2, E<ge> 1.24.9, E<ge> 1.22.10 and E<ge>
1.20.13.  (Thanks: Dan Berrange, Pino Toscano).

=item Shellshock (bash CVE-2014-6271)

This bash bug indirectly affects libguestfs.  For more information
see:
L<https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2014-September/msg00252.html>

=head2 API

=head3 New APIs

=over 4

=item C<guestfs_clear_backend_setting>

=item C<guestfs_get_backend_setting>

=item C<guestfs_set_backend_setting>

Use these APIs to set individual backend settings.

=item C<guestfs_cpio_out>

Convert a directory within the disk image to cpio format.

=item C<guestfs_journal_get_realtime_usec>

Fetch precise journal times, see L<sd_journal_get_realtime_usec(3)>.

=item C<guestfs_lstatns>

=item C<guestfs_lstatnslist>

=item C<guestfs_statns>

Enhanced versions of C<guestfs_lstat>, C<guestfs_lstatlist>,
C<guestfs_stat> which return nanosecond timestamps.

=back

=head2 Build changes

Libguestfs can now be built with qemu 2.x.

Add support for packaging the appliance on Mageia (Joseph Wang,
Thierry Vignaud).

Augeas is now a required dependency.

Flex and bison are now required dependencies.

=head2 Internals

User-Mode Linux (UML) is no longer a supported backend (although still
available).  It will be supported again once someone steps in and
fixes various regressions and brokenness in the UML (Linux) kernel.

You can now connect gdb to qemu by specifying
C<LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS=gdb>

Serial BIOS (sgabios) is now used by the libvirt backend (on x86 only)
so that we see early BIOS messages.

For the OCaml virt tools, exceptions are now handled and printed by a
common function.

A GCC warning about large stack frames is now enabled by default.
Several places that used large arrays and structures on the stack have
been fixed.

There is now a test for booting the appliance repeatedly.  Useful for
finding kernel leaks.  See: F<tests/qemu/qemu-boot.c>

There is a test for testing the speed of various qemu features such as
virtio-serial uploads and block device writes.  See:
F<tests/qemu/qemu-speed-test.c>

GCC warnings are now enabled for OCaml-C bindings in the OCaml virt
tools.

The code for editing files used by L<virt-edit(1)>, L<guestfish(1)>
C<edit> command, L<virt-customize(1)> I<--edit> option and more is now
shared between all these utilities (thanks Pino Toscano).

The FUSE tests were rewritten in C to ensure finer control over how
system calls are tested.

The F<update-bugs.sh> script has been fixed so it should no longer
create an empty C<BUGS> file if the Bugzilla server is unavailable.

The L<virt-resize(1)> tests now use a stochastic method to ensure much
deeper and broader testing.

When the network is enabled, the appliance now uses DHCP to acquire an
IP address.

If libvirt is being used then the appliance will connect to C<virbr0>
(can be overridden by setting
C<LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS=network_bridge=E<lt>some_bridgeE<gt>>).
This enables full-featured network connections, with working ICMP,
ping and so on.

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.26

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.24.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 Tools

L<virt-customize(1)> is a new tool for customizing virtual machine
disk images.  It lets you install packages, edit configuration files,
run scripts, set passwords and so on.  L<virt-builder(1)> and
L<virt-sysprep(1)> use virt-customize, and command line options across
all these tools are now identical.

L<virt-diff(1)> is a new tool for showing the differences between the
filesystems of two virtual machines.  It is mainly useful when showing
what files have been changed between snapshots.

L<virt-builder(1)> has been greatly enhanced.  There are many more
ways to customize the virtual machine.  It can pull templates from
multiple repositories.  A parallelized internal xzcat implementation
speeds up template decompression.  Virt-builder uses an optimizing
planner to choose the fastest way to build the VM.  It is now easier
to use virt-builder from other programs.  Internationalization support
has been added to metadata.  More efficient SELinux relabelling of
files.  Can build guests for multiple architectures.  Error messages
have been improved.
(Pino Toscano)

L<virt-sparsify(1)> has a new I<--in-place> option.  This sparsifies
an image in place (without copying it) and is also much faster.
(Lots of help provided by Paolo Bonzini)

L<virt-sysprep(1)> can delete and scrub files under user control.  You
can lock user accounts or set random passwords on accounts.  Can
remove more log files.  Can unsubscribe a guest from Red Hat
Subscription Manager.  New flexible way to enable and disable
operations.
(Wanlong Gao, Pino Toscano)

L<virt-win-reg(1)> allows you to use URIs to specify remote disk
images.

L<virt-format(1)> can now pass the extra space that it recovers back
to the host.

L<guestfish(1)> has additional environment variables to give fine
control over the C<E<gt>E<lt>fsE<gt>> prompt.  Guestfish reads its
(rarely used) configuration file in a different order now so that
local settings override global settings.
(Pino Toscano)

L<virt-make-fs(1)> was rewritten in C, but is unchanged in terms of
functionality and command line usage.

=head3 Language bindings

The OCaml bindings have a new C<Guestfs.Errno> module, used to check
the error number returned by C<Guestfs.last_errno>.

PHP tests now work.
(Pino Toscano)

=head3 Inspection

Inspection can recognize Debian live images.

=head3 Architectures

ARMv7 (32 bit) now supports KVM acceleration.

Aarch64 (ARM 64 bit) is supported, but the appliance part does not
work yet.

PPC64 support has been fixed and enhanced.

=head2 Security

=over 4

=item Denial of service when inspecting disk images with corrupt btrfs volumes

It was possible to crash libguestfs (and programs that use libguestfs
as a library) by presenting a disk image containing a corrupt btrfs
volume.

This was caused by a NULL pointer dereference causing a denial of
service, and is not thought to be exploitable any further.

See commit d70ceb4cbea165c960710576efac5a5716055486 for the fix.  This
fix is included in libguestfs stable branches S<E<ge> 1.26.0>, S<E<ge>
1.24.6> and S<E<ge> 1.22.8>, and also in RHEL S<E<ge> 7.0>.
Earlier versions of libguestfs are not vulnerable.

=item Better generation of random root passwords and random seeds

When generating random root passwords and random seeds, two bugs were
fixed which are possibly security related.  Firstly we no longer read
excessive bytes from F</dev/urandom> (most of which were just thrown
away).  Secondly we changed the code to avoid modulo bias.  These
issues were not thought to be exploitable.
(Both changes suggested by Edwin Török)

=back

=head2 API

GUID parameters are now validated when they are passed to API calls,
whereas previously you could have passed any string.
(Pino Toscano)

=head3 New APIs

=over 4

=item C<guestfs_add_drive_opts>: new C<discard> parameter

The new C<discard> parameter allows fine-grained control over
discard/trim support for a particular disk.  This allows the host file
to become more sparse (or thin-provisioned) when you delete files or
issue the C<guestfs_fstrim> API call.

=item C<guestfs_add_domain>: new parameters: C<cachemode>, C<discard>

These parameters are passed through when adding the domain's disks.

=item C<guestfs_blkdiscard>

Discard all blocks on a guestfs device.  Combined with the C<discard>
parameter above, this makes the host file sparse.

=item C<guestfs_blkdiscardzeroes>

Test if discarded blocks read back as zeroes.

=item C<guestfs_compare_*>

=item C<guestfs_copy_*>

For each struct returned through the API, libguestfs now generates
C<guestfs_compare_*> and C<guestfs_copy_*> functions to allow you to
compare and copy structs.

=item C<guestfs_copy_attributes>

Copy attributes (like permissions, xattrs, ownership) from one
file to another.
(Pino Toscano)

=item C<guestfs_disk_create>

A flexible API for creating empty disk images from scratch.  This
avoids the need to call out to external programs like L<qemu-img(1)>.

=item C<guestfs_get_backend_settings>

=item C<guestfs_set_backend_settings>

Per-backend settings (can also be set via the environment variable
C<LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS>).  The main use for this is forcing TCG
mode in the qemu-based backends, for example:

 export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=direct
 export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS=force_tcg

=item C<guestfs_part_get_name>

Get the label or name of a partition (for GPT disk images).

=back

=head2 Build changes

The following extra packages are required to build libguestfs 1.26:

=over 4

=item supermin E<ge> 5

Supermin version 5 is required to build this version of libguestfs.

=item flex, bison

Virt-builder now uses a real parser to parse its metadata file, so
these tools are required.

=item xz

This is now a required build dependency, where previously it was
(in theory) optional.

=back

=head2 Internals

PO message extraction rewritten to be more robust.
(Pino Toscano)

C<podwrapper> gives an error if the I<--insert> or I<--verbatim>
argument pattern is not found.

Libguestfs now passes the qemu I<-enable-fips> option to enable FIPS,
if qemu supports it.

C<./configure --without-qemu> can be used if you don't want to specify
a default hypervisor.

Copy-on-write [COW] overlays, used for example for read-only drives,
are now created through an internal backend API (C<.create_cow_overlay>).

Libvirt backend uses some funky C macros to generate XML.  These are
simpler and safer.

The ChangeLog file format has changed.  It is now just the same as
C<git log>, instead of using a custom format.

Appliance start-up has changed:

=over 4

=item *

The libguestfs appliance now initializes LVM the same way as it is
done on physical machines.

=item *

The libguestfs appliance does not write an empty string to
F</proc/sys/kernel/hotplug> when starting up.

Note that you B<must> configure your kernel to have
C<CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH=""> otherwise you will get strange LVM
errors (this applies as much to any Linux machine, not just
libguestfs).
(Peter Rajnoha)

=back

Libguestfs can now be built on arches that have L<ocamlc(1)> but not
L<ocamlopt(1)>.
(Hilko Bengen, Olaf Hering)

You cannot use C<./configure --disable-daemon --enable-appliance>.  It
made no sense anyway.  Now it is expressly forbidden by the configure
script.

The packagelist file uses C<m4> for macro expansion instead of C<cpp>.

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.24

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.22.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

User-Mode Linux (UML) can be used as an alternative backend
(ie. instead of KVM).  This improves performance especially
when using libguestfs inside a VM (eg. in the cloud).  UML is
supported as a first-class backend.
See L<guestfs(3)/USER-MODE LINUX BACKEND> for how to use this.

ARM (32 bit) and PPC64 are now fully supported.

=head3 Tools

L<virt-builder(1)> is a new tool for building virtual machine images.
It lets you rapidly and securely create guests and customize them.

New L<virt-sysprep(1)> operations:
Remove files in F</tmp> and F</var/tmp>.
Remove RPM database files.
Change root and user passwords.
More log files are removed.
New operations which are not enabled by default:
Create random UUIDs for filesystems.
Reset firewall rules.
(Wanlong Gao)

L<virt-resize(1)> and virt-sysprep can now use URIs to specify a
remote disk.

Use C<guestfish -N filename=type> to create a named disk image
(instead of the default F<test1.img> etc).

L<virt-sparsify(1)> now tests if there is enough disk space to
complete the operation, instead of possibly running out of space half
way through.

L<virt-format(1)> and L<virt-make-fs(1)>: new I<--label> option for
setting filesystem label.

virt-resize I<--no-sparse> flag can be used to resize on to partitions
and other targets that are not zeroed.

=head3 Language bindings

New bindings for the Go programming language.

=head3 API

Support for the systemd journal.

C<guestfs_add_drive_opts> can now control the qemu caching mode
through a new C<cachemode> parameter.  You can select improved
performance for temporary drives, or safety.

C<guestfs_set_label> now works for XFS and btrfs.

New GUESTFS_EVENT_WARNING event for warning messages.

=head3 Inspection

Better inspection of SUSE guests (Olaf Hering).

Better support for non-standard Windows %systemroot% (Matthew Booth).

Enhanced error reporting for Augeas errors.

=head2 Security

=over 4

=item CVE-2013-2124

L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=968306>

A denial of service was possible when inspecting certain guests.  The
fix has been backported to 1.20 and 1.22 branches.

=item CVE-2013-4419

L<https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2013-October/msg00031.html>

Fix insecure temporary directory handling for remote guestfish.  The
fix has been backported to 1.20 and 1.22 branches.

=back

=head2 New APIs

 add-drive-scratch: Add a temporary scratch drive
 aug-label
 aug-setm
 journal-open: Systemd journal support
 journal-close
 journal-next
 journal-skip

C<is-file>, C<is-dir>, C<is-blockdev>, C<is-chardev>, C<is-fifo>,
C<is-socket> APIs now have an extra C<followsymlinks> flag.

C<add-drive> has a new C<cachemode> parameter.

=head2 Build changes

The following packages are required to build libguestfs 1.24:

=over 4

=item Augeas E<ge> 1.0.0

=back

The following optional packages may be added to enhance functionality
but are not required:

=over 4

=item sd-journal

To read journal files from guests which use that.

=item url_mkcow

For UML backend.

=item curl

=item gpg

=item xz

For virt-builder.

=item golang E<ge> 1.1.1

For Go language bindings.

=back

=head2 Internals

New C<make check-*> rules replace C<make extra-tests>.  See C<make
help> and L<guestfs(3)> for details.

Perl code can now be valgrinded.

Inspection code is now fuzz-tested.

C<make> no longer recurses into the generator directory in every other
directory.  This reduces the overhead of builds considerably.

Additional tests for Augeas, hivex.

Add a launch timeout of 20 minutes waiting for the appliance to start
up.

Add a timeout (4 hours) to all tests so we can catch the case where
qemu or other components hang.

Use kvmclock and C<-cpu host>.  This improves clock stability and
overall performance.

C<./configure --enable-packet-dump> mode is fixed.

C<./configure --enable-valgrind-daemon> mode has been rewritten.  It
is now feasible for developers to keep this flag enabled at all times.

Backends have been refactored to be modular (although they are not
actually loadable modules).

When enabled, the network now uses resolver configuration
(ie. /etc/resolv.conf) from the host.

The SYSLINUX and EXTLINUX bootloaders can now be installed in disk
images using the API.

Inspection can now handle filesystems such as btrfs where subvolumes
are separately mountable (Matthew Booth).

"Attach methods" are now known as "backends".  Compatibility with
existing code is preserved.

Filenames can contain ':', as long as newer QEMU is being used.

=head3 Tools

Virt-alignment-scan and virt-df scan multiple guests in parallel.

Guestmount now passes errno accurately back to userspace in almost
all cases.

Guestfish and other tools can now use a URI-like syntax to access
remote disks, eg:

 guestfish -a ssh://example.com/path/to/disk.img

Guestfish and guestmount now allow you to specify the filesystem type
when mounting, which is more secure (Dave Vasilevsky).

Guestfish is now the "guest filesystem shell".

Guestfish allows only C<1> C<true> C<t> C<yes> C<y> C<on> C<0>
C<false> C<f> C<no> C<n> C<off> for boolean values (case insensitive),
and gives an error for all other strings.

New tool C<guestunmount> for unmounting FUSE filesystems safely.

C<guestmount --no-fork> flag prevents guestmount from daemonizing.

Virt-resize now uses sparse copies by default, saving considerable
space for guests which are mostly empty.

Bash tab completion has been rewritten and can now handle most tools,
and correctly tab-complete C<--long> options.  In addition, bash
completion scripts are loaded on demand.

=head3 Language bindings

The Java API now supports events.

The Python object now inherits from the C<object> base class.

Python methods which previously returned lists of tuples can now
be made to return a Python dict.  For backwards compatibility, you
have to enable this by using the constructor option
S<C<guestfs.GuestFS (python_return_dict=True)>>.

The PHP bindings are now tested properly, and have had multiple fixes.

The long-deprecated Perl C<Sys::Guestfs::Lib> library has been
removed.
L<https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2013-April/msg00001.html>

=head3 Examples

New example program showing how to enable debugging and capture
log messages.

=head3 Other

Distributors can add arbitrary extra packages to the appliance by
doing:

 ./configure --with-extra-packages="list of package names"

Distributors can use:

 ./configure --with-supermin-extra-options="..."

to add arbitrary extra options to supermin.

=head2 Security

No security issues were found in this release.

=head2 New APIs

 cp-r
 extlinux

 is-whole-device
 part-get-gpt-type
 part-set-gpt-type

=head2 Internals

The febootstrap tool has now been renamed to "supermin".  Libguestfs
can use either, but now prefers "supermin".
L<http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/supermin/>

libxml2 is required to build libguestfs.

The hivexregedit program (from hivex) is required to build from git.

Internal functions can no longer be used unless the caller defines
C<-DGUESTFS_PRIVATE=1>.

Enable C compiler warnings in Python, Ruby bindings.

Fail early and clearly if libvirt does not support qemu/KVM (eg. if
default libvirt connection is to Xen).

C<make print-subdirs> rule, useful for selectively running tests.

Multiple fixes to allow separated (sourcedir != builddir) builds.

Multiple fixes to Haskell bindings.

C<ln> and C<ln-f> APIs now capture C<errno> correctly.

Language binding tests use (mostly) a standard numbering scheme and
aim to test the same range of features in each language.  Also the
number of launches required has been reduced so these tests should run
much more quickly.

Library code internally uses GCC C<__attribute__((cleanup))> (if
available) to simplify memory allocation.

Internal header files have been reorganized.  See the comments in
F<src/guestfs-internal*.h>

Internal code shared between the library and certain tools is now
located in a static C<libutils> library.

Almost all subdirectories can now use parallel builds, although note
that the top-level directories still build in series.

Use of C<PATH_MAX> and C<NAME_MAX> has been eliminated from the code.

The Java API now requires JVM E<ge> 1.6.

Force use of C<serial-tests> with automake E<ge> 1.12.

Use of sockets in the library protocol layer is abstracted, allowing
other non-POSIX layers to be added in future (see
F<src/conn-socket.c>).

C<qemu-img info --output json> is used if available, for more secure
parsing of the output of this command.

Distros can now use C<make INSTALLDIRS=vendor install> to place Ruby
bindings in vendordir.  This eliminates a non-upstream patch carried
by both Fedora and Debian.

Valgrind log files are now written to F<tmp/valgrind-I<DATE>-I<PID>.log>

C<make clean> cleans the local C<tmp/> directory.

The C API tests have been rewritten using a more flexible generator
language that allows arbitrary C code to be executing during tests.

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.20

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.18.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 libvirt and sVirt (SELinux confinement)

You can I<optionally> use libvirt to launch and manage the backend
appliance by:

=over 4

=item *

setting C<LIBGUESTFS_ATTACH_METHOD=libvirt[:URI]>

=item *

using C<./configure --with-default-attach-method=libvirt[:URI]>

=item *

or calling the API method C<guestfs_set_attach_method>

=back

SVirt (SELinux confinement) is used to secure the libguestfs
appliance, if the libvirt backend is selected.

=head3 virtio-scsi, larger number of drives, hotplugging

Virtio-scsi is now used by default, if it is available.  This greatly
increases the number of drives that can be added to a single
libguestfs handle (up to 255).

You can now hotplug drives (add and remove drives after launch).

Libguestfs can now handle E<gt> 25 disks, in all APIs, tools and tests.

You can label drives when adding them, then refer to them by label
(F</dev/disk/guestfs/LABEL>) instead of having to use device names
(F</dev/sda>).

=head3 new library features

POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Linux filesystem capabilities
can now be read and written through the API.

Windows Dynamic Disks are now supported.  The metadata can only be
read (volumes cannot be modified or created).  However the
data/filesystems in the volumes themselves can be mounted, read and
written (Matthew Booth).

Hivex (Windows Registry editing) is now directly supported through the
API, making reading or editing the Windows Registry much more
efficient.

Several libguestfs APIs were reimplemented so they no longer have any
limits on output.  The reimplemented APIs are: C<guestfs_cat>,
C<guestfs_find>, C<guestfs_read_file>, C<guestfs_read_lines>,
C<guestfs_write>, C<guestfs_write_append>, C<guestfs_lstatlist>,
C<guestfs_lxattrlist>, C<guestfs_readlinklist>, C<guestfs_ls>.

=head3 virt tools

C<guestfish touch 'win:c:\new_file'> now works as expected.

C<guestfish> has a new I<--network> option, which enables the user
network in libguestfs.

You can set C<GUESTFISH_PS1> to use fancy prompts in C<guestfish>.

C<rsync>, C<ssh>, C<less> and C<lrzip> commands are now available in
virt-rescue.  In addition, C<rsync> can be used through the API for
doing incremental copies.

C<virt-sparsify> uses qcow2 v3 for increased efficiency.

C<virt-sysprep> enhancements:

=over 4

=item *

generate new UUIDs for PVs and VGs

=item *

remove the local machine ID (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove ABRT data (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove puppet keys and log files (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove process accounting files (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

new I<--firstboot> parameter allowing firstboot scripts
for customizing guests

=item *

remove HOSTNAME field from C<ifcfg-eth*> files (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

miscellaneous improvements for SuSE (Olaf Hering)

=item *

remove man pages cache (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove crash data generated by kexec-tools (Wanlong Gao)

=back

C<virt-make-fs> can now create virtual floppy disks (VFDs).

C<guestmount> has a I<--pid-file> option, which can be used to avoid a
race condition between unmounting the filesystem and using the
underlying disk image.

=head3 language bindings

Full-featured Lua bindings have been added in this release
(thanks to Jerome Vuarand for many suggestions).

In Ruby, optional arguments hash is optional.

In Python, optional arguments now don't use special "sentinel"
values, so any integer can be passed as an optional argument.

Erlang bindings now come with examples and tests.

Erlang bindings now handle 64 bit integer parameters correctly.

The automated 'bindtests' now test for 64 bit cleanliness in parameter
passing.  Several bugs in the bindings were found and fixed as a
result.

Better handling of blocking and non-blocking functions should make
libguestfs calls more efficient.

=head3 inspection

Windows guests with unlimited-sized Registries are now supported.
By adding the hivex API to the libguestfs API, it is much more
efficient and easier to inspect and modify the Windows Registry
in guests.

Better support for SuSE guests (Olaf Hering).

Return the architecture of installed applications (John Eckersberg).

Windows 8 is now supported.

Fedora 18 is now supported.

Inspection of ISOs/CDs/DVDs can now use the libosinfo database.

=head3 ports

Libguestfs without the appliance can be compiled on Mac OS X
(Masami HIRATA).

RHEL 5 is now explicitly supported through the 'oldlinux' branch
in upstream git.

PowerPC 64 bit is now supported.  Also libguestfs has been
examined for endianness bugs and these have been fixed.

=head3 daemon

A man page for the daemon (L<guestfsd(8)>) is included.

=head2 Security

=head3 guestfish history file

The F<$HOME/.guestfish> history file is now created with 0600
permissions (instead of 0644 before) so it is no longer world
readable.

=head3 CVE-2012-2690

Old versions of both C<virt-edit> and the C<guestfish> C<edit> command
created a new file containing the changes but did not set the
permissions, etc of the new file to match the old one.  The result
of this was that if you edited a security sensitive file such as
F</etc/shadow> then it would be left world-readable after the edit.

This issue was assigned CVE-2012-2690, and is fixed in libguestfs E<ge> 1.16.

In the C API only:

=head2 Internals

qemu E<ge> 1.1 is required (E<ge> 1.2 preferred).

febootstrap E<ge> 3.20 is required.

libvirt is optional, but if you want to use the new libvirt
backend for launching the appliance then libvirt E<ge> 0.10.2 would
be required.

Coverity has been run over the complete codebase, and many
issues fixed (thanks Ondrej Vasik, Kamil Dudka).

Functions which previously had no optargs can now be converted to ones
with optargs, making extending the API much more flexible.  Source and
binary backwards compatibility is preserved for users of the API.

The way that libguestfs APIs and structures are represented in the
generator has changed to use an OCaml struct instead of a tuple.  This
makes generator descriptions more flexible and easier to understand.
For details see commits 39d1a7db and eb185eef.

Separation of the library code into more files:

=over 4

=item *

Launch backends are now located in separate files
eg. F<src/launch-appliance.c>, C<src/launch-libvirt.c>.

=item *

Generated action code is now split over several F<src/action*.c>
files, for faster compilation.

=item *

The huge F<src/guestfs.c> file is now split into smaller logical
units.

=back

POD (documentation) is now generated using a rewritten Perl
program instead of pod2* + shell scripts.

Man pages now contain stable dates (Hilko Bengen).

Skipped tests now exit with code 77, so they appear as
C<SKIP:> in C<make check> output.

The parallel mount-local test has been rewritten in C (RHBZ#838081).

Ruby 1.8.5 is now supported (though Ruby E<ge> 1.9 is preferred).

Perl bindings can be disabled via C<./configure --disable-perl>
(Wulf C. Krueger).  Note that Perl is still required in order to build
libguestfs.

Java bindings are now enabled/disabled using C<./configure --with-java>
or C<./configure --without-java> (Wulf C. Krueger).

New configure options C<./configure --enable-code-profiling> and
C<./configure --enable-code-coverage>.

Multiple fixes to use of 64 bit integers in language bindings.

The appliance backend now uses sgabios instead of vgabios
(Dan Berrange).

The C<./run> script now sets enough environment variables that you
can run OCaml, Python, Ruby, Java, GJS, Erlang, Lua programs.

C<./run --test> flag for running tests with minimal output.  It also
prints the time taken to run each test.

The C<./run> script now builds up paths cumulatively, meaning that you
can use C<./run> twice, or use the libguestfs and libvirt C<./run>
scripts together.

You can extract a list of external commands required by the
daemon, making building the appliance on certain distros easier
(Olaf Hering).

The C<virt-rescue> command is now tested during C<make check>.

The generator now removes unused generated files.  This helps
when going back and forth with git rebase, git bisect, etc.

Tests now run in a separate toplevel C<tmp/> directory in the source.
This allows the directory to be labelled for SELinux (sVirt), and also
makes it easier to clean up.

C<make syntax-check> now works to a greater extent, and many problems
in the main code that were found by syntax-check have been fixed
(thanks Jim Meyering).

Emacs mode (-*- foo -*-) has been added to generated files.

Progress bar output is now sent to F</dev/tty> so it doesn't end up in
the regular output of the program.  virt-resize and virt-sparsify now
suppress progress bars if stdout is not a tty.

There is now a C<./configure --without-libvirt> option.  This is
useful for testing that the code still compiles without libvirt.

There is now an internal mini-library for running commands.  This
allows us to redirect errors from external commands into events.

Code for handling temporary directories and the appliance cache was
completely overhauled.

Code for temporarily ignoring/disabling errors now looks like this:

 guestfs_push_error_handler (g, NULL, NULL);
 guestfs_mkdir (g, "/foo"); /* We don't care if this fails. */
 guestfs_pop_error_handler (g);

The C<tests/extra> directory has gone.  The "extra tests" are now
split into separately runnable targets, such as C<make check-valgrind>.
Use C<make help> to get a summary of the targets.

The C<lpj> option is passed to the appliance kernel when using TCG.
This should improve clock stability (thanks Marcelo Tosatti,
Olaf Hering).

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.18

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.16.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

     http://libguestfs.org/virt-sysprep.1.html

   - virt-sparsify --zero is a new option that zeroes the named
     partition or filesystem

   - virt-sparsify can now safely sparsify Linux swap partitions

   - virt-sparsify fixed so it cleans up after ^C
     http://libguestfs.org/virt-sparsify.1.html

   - a new tool 'libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance' is provided to build
     fixed appliances that can be copied to other machines that don't
     have febootstrap support

=head1 Release notes for libguestfs 1.8

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.6.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

 - Support and packages for Debian and Ubuntu.

 - Daily builds from git repository on Debian and Ubuntu to reduce risk
   of regressions.

 - Port to ArchLinux 'pacman' (thanks Thomas S Hatch).

 - The following tools have been rewritten in C (originally in Perl):

     . virt-cat

 - guestfish, guestmount and the C tools use unified command line option
   parsing, so they support many common options such as '-a disk.img',
   '-d libvirt-domain', '-x', '-v'.  The old command line option
   parsing is preserved for compatibility in scripts etc.

 - virt-inspector can list applications installed in Windows guests, along
   with a great deal of information about those applications.

 - Add support for inspecting: Linux Mint, Mandriva, FreeBSD.

 - guestfish --rw option (with no effect currently) to make potentially
   dangerous write access explicit.

 - guestfish --listen --csh for compatibility with csh, tcsh (thanks
   Eric Blake).

 - The first upstream version that introduced each API function is now
   documented in guestfs(3).

 - guestfs_last_errno allows you to retrieve the errno from the
   daemon, correctly translated to the local operating system.

 - Functions can now have optional parameters.

 - Progress bars and progress notifications can now happen for upload
   commands.

=head2 Security

 - New SECURITY section in guestfs(3) API documentation.

 - virt-inspector no longer runs any guest commands.

 - Inspection code is more careful about avoiding very large files
   from guests which might previously have caused a denial of service.

 - FUSE calls into guestmount are now traced when using guestmount -x.

=head2 New APIs

 - add-domain
 - add-drive-opts
 - getxattr
 - inspect-get-hostname
 - inspect-get-package-format
 - inspect-get-package-management
 - inspect-get-roots
 - inspect-list-applications
 - lgetxattr
 - mkfs-opts

=head2 Internals

 - C programs now only link precisely with the libraries that they use.

 - PCRE, libmagic, hivex and libvirt libraries are now completely
   optional for building.

 - Multiple memory leaks and file descriptor leaks fixed.

 - Add a POD wrapper to unify generation of man pages and HTML files
   across all programs.

 - Source includes phony images of Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu and
   Windows guests.

 - Ruby bindings have 'make install' rule.

 - <guestfs.h> is now a single file.

 - <guestfs.h> does not require XDR headers.

 - ocaml xml-light library is no longer required to build (thanks
   Maxim Koltsov).

 - ./configure --disable-[...] for each language binding (thanks
   Maxim Koltsov).

 - Old ocaml-viewer program removed (use guestfs-browser instead).

 - New C API test type 'InitScratchFS' makes the tests run a little
   more quickly.

 - Excluded packages in the appliance are now listed in a separate
   file appliance/excludelist.in, and can be customized per-distro.

=head2 Bugs fixed

 - 663407 readlink and readlinklist returns /sysroot/ in some paths
 - 661280 virt-rescue: panic when shutting down: "/sbin/reboot: No such file or directory"
 - 657499 checksum: wrong check sum type causes umount to fail
 - 655554 Whole disk paths are not made canonical by virt-inspector
 - 654638 openssl updated to 1.0.0b libguestfs depends on exact file names
 - 652796 ruby bindings not installed by 'make install', hence omitted from the binary distribution

=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.6

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.4.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

 - Use a new method for creating and caching the appliance.  This
   greatly improves the performance of libguestfs, often by a factor
   of x 4 to x 5.

 - Support for guest inspection (like virt-inspector) via the ordinary
   API and all language bindings.  'guestfish -i' option is as a side-
   effect much quicker.

 - virt-inspector and core inspection API can now detect guests running:
   Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS,
   Scientific Linux, Gentoo, Pardus, Arch Linux, MeeGo.

 - Support for LUKS whole-disk encryption in guests.

 - PHP bindings.

 - Progress messages (and progress bars in guestfish and virt-resize)
   for certain long-running operations.

 - virt-df is now much more efficient.  Use '--one-per-guest' to restore
   the old per-guest isolation behaviour.

 - guestfish 'copy-in' and 'copy-out' commands for copying files and
   directories recursively in and out of the guest.

 - guestfish 'hexedit' command for doing binary edits to devices and
   files.

 - Change guestfish -i syntax to allow commands to be specified on the
   command line (retaining backwards compatibility).

 - guestfish '-d <domain>' for adding disks from libvirt domains.

 - guestfish '-N' option supports several new prepared disk image types:
         lvfs : disk with LV formatted with filesystem
           lv : disk with LV
     bootroot : boot+root
   bootrootlv : boot and root on LV

 - guestfish 'more' and 'edit' commands now work with arbitrary files.

 - guestfish '--echo-keys' option allows you to echo keys/passphrases
   while typing them.

 - guestmount now supports -a / -d / -i options, like guestfish.

 - Use virtio-serial for communications with the appliance.  This
   also has a major performance benefit.

 - virt-edit '-b' option to create a backup of edited files.

 - virt-edit '-e' option for non-interactive edits to files.

 - Ability to capture core dumps from the appliance (thanks Matthew Booth).

 - virt-rescue now shuts down cleanly (thanks Matthew Booth).

 - virt-rescue now has a --network option to enable network access.

 - virt-resize can now handle guests which use GPT partition table format.

 - virt-resize has better support for shrinking guests.

 - virt-resize supports qcow2-format guests.

 - $TMPDIR can be used to override almost all temporary directory usage.

 - OCaml users can use an alternate OO-style of coding, eg. g#launch ()

 - The API supports calls which take optional parameters, eg.
     $g->add_drive_opts ("disk", readonly => 1);

 - Trace output now escapes and shortens large strings (thanks
   Matthew Booth).

 - Autosync is now on by default, resulting in more reliable behaviour
   when the handle is closed.

 - virt-df --uuid option allows you to follow a domain across migration
   and renaming.

 - Translations of manual pages.

=head2 Security

 - CVE-2010-3851 libguestfs: missing disk format specifier when adding a disk
   https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010-October/msg00036.html
   This is comprehensively fixed in this release, and the fix will be
   backported to the other stable branches after more testing.

 - virt-inspector no longer relies on untrusted guest code to list
   applications in some guests.

=head2 New APIs

  download-offset, file-architecture, findfs-label, findfs-uuid,
  inspect-os, inspect-get-arch, inspect-get-distro,
  inspect-get-filesystems, inspect-get-major-version,
  inspect-get-minor-version, inspect-get-mountpoints,
  inspect-get-product-name, inspect-get-type, is-blockdev, is-chardev,
  is-fifo, is-lv, is-socket, is-symlink, list-filesystems, luks-add-key,
