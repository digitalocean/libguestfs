The command lists the RPMs installed inside a Fedora / RHEL / CentOS
or other RPM-based virtual machine.  It does this by running the
<code>rpm -qa</code> command directly inside the machine.

<p>
To use it you need to know the partition or LV <i>inside</i> the
VM that contains the root filesystem, so for example:
</p>

<pre>
rpmqa.sh guest.img /dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 | less
</pre>

<p>
You can write a similar command for Debian-based virtual machines
very easily.
