If you messed up your VM and made it unbootable, it's
often useful to be able to go in and edit <code>/boot/grub/grub.conf</code>.
This guestfish script shows how to do that.

<p>
Usage assumes that the VM has a separate <code>/boot</code>
partition containing grub, which is usually the case.  So
for example:
</p>

<pre>
editgrub.sh broken-guest.img /dev/sda1
</pre>
