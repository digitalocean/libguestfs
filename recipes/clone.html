This script shows how you might have a library of premade
virtual machines ready for cloning, but as a final step you
use libguestfs or guestfish to customize some configuration
files inside the VM before it's ready to go.

In this simple recipe, we overwrite the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> file
with a new nameserver entry, and change <code>/etc/HOSTNAME</code>.

There are lots of possible improvements to this script, such as
using qcow snapshots so that cloned VMs share storage with their
"parent" preimages.
