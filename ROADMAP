(4) For general "might be good to have" items, see 'TODO'.

For next major stable release (1.20)
------------------------------------

* Allow remote libvirt volumes to be accessed.  This requires some
  enhancements to libvirt which have been agreed but not yet
  implemented.

Bugs assigned to 1.20 (put "1.20" in the Devel Whiteboard field in
Bugzilla):

Beyond 1.20
-----------

* Make 'guestfish --ro' be the default, and get users to use
  'guestfish --rw' for write access (but allow the default to be
  overridden in a configuration file).  This was originally planned
  for 1.10 but there's not nearly enough adoption of the new
  'guestfish --rw' option out there to do this yet.

* Allow alternate methods to start the appliance, including through
  libvirt, by connecting to an existing appliance, and remotely over
  ssh.  Libvirt integration was originally planned for 1.10 but we
  didn't get patches in time.

* Write a new partition handling library to replace parted, and use it
  instead of parted.  (RHBZ#593511, RHBZ#642821).

* Hot plugging of disks using QMP.  This would allow more efficient
  reuse of the appliance in some circumstances: multiple disks
  (ie. VMs) can be added in turn to the same appliance.  In particular
  this would help virt-df.

  [Note this requires upstream work on QMP, see:
