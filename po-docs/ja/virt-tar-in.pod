virt-tar-in - Unpack a tarball into a virtual machine disk image.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-tar-in -a disk.img data.tar /destination

 virt-tar-in -d domain data.tar /destination

 zcat data.tar.gz | virt-tar-in -d domain - /destination

=head1 WARNING

Using C<virt-tar-in> on live virtual machines can be dangerous, potentially
causing disk corruption.  The virtual machine must be shut down before you
use this command.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<virt-tar-in> unpacks an uncompressed tarball into a virtual machine disk
image or named libvirt domain.

The first parameter is the tar file.  Use C<-> to read the tar file from
standard input.  The second parameter is the absolute target directory to
unpack into.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Upload a home directory to a guest:

 virt-tar-in -d MyGuest homes.tar /home

=head1 JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH

This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the
L<guestfish(1)> C<tar-in> command.  For anything more complex than a trivial
copy, you are probably better off using guestfish directly.

=head1 OPTIONS

Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read
L<guestfish(1)> to see the full list of options.
