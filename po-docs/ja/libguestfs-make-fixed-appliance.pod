libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance - Make a "fixed appliance" for libguestfs

=head1 書式

 libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance [--options] OUTPUTDIR

 libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance [--options] --xz

=head1 説明

libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance lets you make a pre-built binary appliance
for libguestfs.

B<Note that ordinary users should not need to run this tool>.  The only
reason to use it is if you want to make a self-contained libguestfs
appliance that can be copied to another machine or platform that doesn't
support L<febootstrap(8)>.  To understand why you might need to use this
tool, read the section L</FIXED APPLIANCE> below.

Instead of running this tool, you can download fixed appliances from
L<http://libguestfs.org/download/binaries/appliance/>.  These appliances
were made using this tool.

There are two ways to use this tool.

=over 4

=item *

Specify an output directory, for example:

 libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance /usr/local/lib/guestfs/appliance

The output directory is created if it does not exist.  Four files are
created in this directory:

 <OUTPUTDIR>/kernel
 <OUTPUTDIR>/initrd
 <OUTPUTDIR>/root
 <OUTPUTDIR>/README.fixed

Note that C<I<OUTPUTDIR>/root> is a sparse file, so take care when copying
it.

You can then run libguestfs (possibly after copying this directory to
another machine) by setting the environment variable LIBGUESTFS_PATH to
C<OUTPUTDIR>.

=item *

The alternative method is to use the I<--xz> option to create a compressed
tarball:

 libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance --xz

これは呼び出した I<カレント> ディレクトリーに tar ファイルを作成します:

 appliance-<VERSION>.tar.xz

(ここで C<VERSION> は libguestfs のバージョンです)。  tar ファイルは 4 つのファイルを含みます:

 appliance/kernel
 appliance/initrd
 appliance/root
 appliance/README.fixed

C<appliance/root> はスパースファイルであるため、コピーするときには気をつける必要があるため、注意してください。

=back

=head1 オプション

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Display short usage information and exit.

=item B<-V>

=item B<--version>

バージョン番号を表示して終了します。

=item B<--xz>

Instead of creating the appliance in an output directory, create a
compressed tarball of the appliance in the current directory called
C<appliance-I<VERSION>.tar.xz> where C<VERSION> is the version of
libguestfs.

Using I<--xz> can take some time.  If working normally, the tool is
completely silent when it is running.

=head1 FIXED APPLIANCE

When libguestfs (or libguestfs tools) are run, they search a path looking
for an appliance.  The path is built into libguestfs, or can be set using
the C<LIBGUESTFS_PATH> environment variable.

Normally a supermin appliance is located on this path (see
L<febootstrap(8)/SUPERMIN APPLIANCE>).  libguestfs reconstructs this into a
full appliance by running L<febootstrap-supermin-helper(8)>.

However, a simpler "fixed appliance" can also be used.  libguestfs detects
this by looking for a directory on the path containing four files called
C<kernel>, C<initrd>, C<root> and C<README.fixed> (note the C<README.fixed>
file must be present as well).

If the fixed appliance is found, libguestfs skips febootstrap entirely and
just runs qemu with the kernel, initrd and root disk from the fixed
appliance.

Thus the fixed appliance can be used when a platform or Linux distro does
not support febootstrap.  You build the fixed appliance on a platform that
does support febootstrap, and copy it over, and use that to run libguestfs.

=head1 LICENSING

The fixed appliance is a complete Linux binary distro.  If you distribute
it, you may need to distribute corresponding source files to remain in legal
compliance with the licenses of the software in the appliance (such as the
GNU General Public License).

=head1 終了ステータス

libguestfs-make-fixed-appliance returns I<0> if the appliance was built
without errors.

=head1 環境変数

For the full list of environment variables which may affect libguestfs,
please see the L<guestfs(3)> manual page.
