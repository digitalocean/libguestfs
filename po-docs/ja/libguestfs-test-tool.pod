libguestfs-test-tool - Diagnostics for libguestfs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 libguestfs-test-tool [--options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

libguestfs-test-tool is a test program shipped with libguestfs to allow you
to check basic libguestfs functionality is working.  This is needed because
libguestfs occasionally breaks for reasons beyond our control: usually
because of changes in the underlying qemu or kernel packages, or the host
environment.

If you suspect a problem in libguestfs, then just run:

 libguestfs-test-tool

It will print lots of diagnostic messages.

If it runs to completion successfully, you will see this near the end:

 ===== TEST FINISHED OK =====

and the test tool will exit with code 0.

If it fails (and/or exits with non-zero error code), please paste the
I<complete, unedited> output of the test tool into a bug report.  More
information about reporting bugs can be found on the
L<http://libguestfs.org/> website.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Display short usage information and exit.

=item B<--qemu qemu_binary>

If you have downloaded another qemu binary, point this option at the full
path of the binary to try it.

=item B<--qemudir qemu_source_dir>

If you have compiled qemu from source, point this option at the source
directory to try it.

=item B<-t N>

=item B<--timeout N>

Set the launch timeout to C<N> seconds.  The default is 600 seconds (10
minutes) which does not usually need to be adjusted.

=head1 TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF QEMU

If you have compiled another version of qemu from source and would like to
try that, then you can use the I<--qemudir> option to point to the qemu
source directory.

If you have downloaded a qemu binary from somewhere, use the I<--qemu>
option to point to the binary.

Note when using these options, you can ignore the business of qemu wrapper
scripts (L<guestfs(3)/QEMU WRAPPERS>), since libguestfs-test-tool writes a
wrapper script for you if one is needed.

=head1 TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT KERNEL

If you are using febootstrap E<ge> 3.8 then you can select which kernel
libguestfs tries.  You do this by setting the environment variables
C<FEBOOTSTRAP_KERNEL> and/or C<FEBOOTSTRAP_MODULES>.

Refer to L<febootstrap-supermin-helper(8)/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES> for further
information.

=head1 SELF-DIAGNOSIS

Refer to L<guestfs(3)/APPLIANCE BOOT PROCESS> to understand the messages
produced by libguestfs-test-tool and/or possible errors.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

libguestfs-test-tool returns I<0> if the tests completed without error, or
I<1> if there was an error.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

For the full list of environment variables which may affect libguestfs,
please see the L<guestfs(3)> manual page.
