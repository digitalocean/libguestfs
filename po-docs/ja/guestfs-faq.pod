guestfs-faq - libguestfs のよくある質問 (FAQ)

=head1 libguestfs について

=head2 libguestfs とは?

libguestfs
はディスクイメージを作成、参照および変更するための手段です。ディスクイメージの中を参照する、含まれているファイルを変更する、イメージを新規作成する、およびさまざまなことができます。スクリプトやプログラムから、およびコマンドラインからはとくに有用です。

libguestfs is a C library (hence "lib-"), and a set of tools built on this
library, and bindings for many common programming languages.

libguestfs が実行できることの詳細はホームページ (L<http://libguestfs.org>) にある紹介を参照できます。

=head2 What are the virt tools?

Virt tools (website: L<http://virt-tools.org>) are a whole set of
virtualization management tools aimed at system administrators.  Some of
them come from libguestfs, some from libvirt and many others from other open
source projects.  So virt tools is a superset of libguestfs.  However
libguestfs comes with many important tools.  See L<http://libguestfs.org>
for a full list.

=head2 libguestfs は { libvirt / KVM / Red Hat / Fedora } が必要ですか?

いいえ！

libvirt は libguestfs に必須ではありません。

libguestfs works with any disk image, including ones created in VMware, KVM,
qemu, VirtualBox, Xen, and many other hypervisors, and ones which you have
created from scratch.

S<Red Hat> sponsors (ie. pays for) development of libguestfs and a huge
number of other open source projects.  But you can run libguestfs and the
virt tools on many different Linux distros and Mac OS X.  Some virt tools
have been ported to Windows.

=head2 How does libguestfs compare to other tools?

=over 4

=item I<vs. kpartx>

Libguestfs takes a different approach from kpartx.  kpartx needs root, and
mounts filesystems on the host kernel (which can be insecure - see
L<guestfs(3)/SECURITY>).  Libguestfs isolates your host kernel from guests,
is more flexible, scriptable, supports LVM, doesn't require root, is
isolated from other processes, and cleans up after itself.  Libguestfs is
more than just file access because you can use it to create images from
scratch.

=item I<vs. vdfuse>

vdfuse is like kpartx but for VirtualBox images.  See the kpartx comparison
above.  You can use libguestfs on the partition files exposed by vdfuse,
although it's not necessary since libguestfs can access VirtualBox images
directly.

=item I<vs. qemu-nbd>

nbd is like kpartx but for qcow2 images.  See the kpartx comparison above.
You can use libguestfs and qemu-nbd together for access to block devices
over the network.

=item I<vs. mounting filesystems in the host>

Mounting guest filesystems in the host is insecure and should be avoided
completely for untrusted guests.  Use libguestfs to provide a layer of
protection against filesystem exploits.  See also L<guestmount(1)>.

=item I<vs. parted>

Libguestfs supports LVM.  Libguestfs uses parted and provides most parted
features through the libguestfs API.

=head1 GETTING HELP AND REPORTING BUGS

=head2 How do I know what version I'm using?

最も簡単な方法は次のとおりです:

 guestfish --version

Libguestfs development happens along an unstable branch and we periodically
create a stable branch which we backport stable patches to.  To find out
more, read L<guestfs(3)/LIBGUESTFS VERSION NUMBERS>.

=head2 How can I get help?

=head2 What mailing lists or chat rooms are available?

If you are a S<Red Hat> customer using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, please
contact S<Red Hat Support>: L<http://redhat.com/support>

There is a mailing list, mainly for development, but users are also welcome
to ask questions about libguestfs and the virt tools:
L<https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/libguestfs>

You can also talk to us on IRC channel C<#libguestfs> on FreeNode.  We're
not always around, so please stay in the channel after asking your question
and someone will get back to you.

For other virt tools (not ones supplied with libguestfs) there is a general
virt tools mailing list:
L<https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/virt-tools-list>

=head1 一般的な問題

See also L<guestfs(3)/LIBGUESTFS GOTCHAS> for some "gotchas" with using the
libguestfs API.

=head2 "Could not allocate dynamic translator buffer"

This obscure error is in fact an SELinux failure.  You have to enable the
following SELinux boolean:

 setsebool -P virt_use_execmem=on

For more information see
L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=806106>.

=head2 "child process died unexpectedly"

This error indicates that qemu failed or the host kernel could not boot.  To
get further information about the failure, you have to run:

 libguestfs-test-tool

If, after using this, you still don't understand the failure, contact us
(see previous section).

=head2 Non-ASCII characters don't appear on VFAT filesystems.

Typical symptoms of this problem:

=over 4

=item *

You get an error when you create a file where the filename contains
non-ASCII characters, particularly non 8-bit characters from Asian languages
(Chinese, Japanese, etc).  The filesystem is VFAT.

=item *

When you list a directory from a VFAT filesystem, filenames appear as
question marks.

=back

This is a design flaw of the GNU/Linux system.

VFAT stores long filenames as UTF-16 characters.  When opening or returning
filenames, the Linux kernel has to translate these to some form of 8 bit
string.  UTF-8 would be the obvious choice, except for Linux users who
persist in using non-UTF-8 locales (the user's locale is not known to the
kernel because it's a function of libc).

Therefore you have to tell the kernel what translation you want done when
you mount the filesystem.  The two methods are the C<iocharset> parameter
(which is not relevant to libguestfs) and the C<utf8> flag.

そのため、VFAT ファイルシステムを使用するには、マウント時に C<utf8> フラグを追加する必要があります。guestfish
から、次のように使用します:

 ><fs> mount-options utf8 /dev/sda1 /

または guestfish コマンドラインにおいて:

 guestfish [...] -m /dev/sda1:/:utf8

または API から:

 guestfs_mount_options (g, "utf8", "/dev/sda1", "/");

The kernel will then translate filenames to and from UTF-8 strings.

We considered adding this mount option transparently, but unfortunately
there are several problems with doing that:

=over 4

=item *

On some Linux systems, the C<utf8> mount option doesn't work.  We don't
precisely understand what systems or why, but this was reliably reported by
one user.

=item *

It would prevent you from using the C<iocharset> parameter because it is
incompatible with C<utf8>.  It is probably not a good idea to use this
parameter, but we don't want to prevent it.

=back

=head2 Non-ASCII characters appear as underscore (_) on ISO9660 filesystems.

The filesystem was not prepared correctly with mkisofs or genisoimage.  Make
sure the filesystem was created using Joliet and/or Rock Ridge extensions.
libguestfs does not require any special mount options to handle the
filesystem.

=head2 How can I compile and install libguestfs from source?

If your Linux distro has a working port of supermin (that is, Fedora, S<Red
Hat Enterprise Linux E<ge> 6.3>, Debian, Ubuntu and ArchLinux)  then you
should just be able to compile from source in the usual way.  Download the
latest tarball from L<http://libguestfs.org/download>, unpack it, and start
by reading the README file.

If you I<don't> have supermin, you will need to use the "fixed appliance
method".  See: L<http://libguestfs.org/download/binaries/appliance/>

Patches to port supermin to more Linux distros are welcome.

=head2 Why do I get an error when I try to rebuild from the source RPMs supplied by
Red Hat / Fedora?

Because of the complexity of building the libguestfs appliance, the source
RPMs provided cannot be rebuilt directly using C<rpmbuild> or C<mock>.

If you use Koji (which is open source software and may be installed
locally), then the SRPMs can be rebuilt in Koji.
L<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji>

If you don't have or want to use Koji, then you have to give libguestfs
access to the network so it can download the RPMs for building the
appliance.  You also need to set an RPM macro to tell libguestfs to use the
network.  Put the following line into a file called C<$HOME/.rpmmacros>:

 %libguestfs_buildnet   1

mock を使用しているならば、次を実行します:

 mock -D '%libguestfs_buildnet 1' [etc]

=head2 どのように sVirt をサポートしますか?

Note for Fedora/RHEL users: This configuration is the default starting with
S<Fedora 18> and S<RHEL 7>.  If you find any problems, please let us know or
file a bug.

L<SVirt|http://selinuxproject.org/page/SVirt> provides a hardened appliance
using SELinux, making it very hard for a rogue disk image to "escape" from
the confinement of libguestfs and damage the host (it's fair to say that
even in standard libguestfs this would be hard, but sVirt provides an extra
layer of protection for the host and more importantly protects virtual
machines on the same host from each other).

Currently to enable sVirt you will need libvirt E<ge> 0.10.2 (1.0 or later
preferred), libguestfs E<ge> 1.20, and the SELinux policies from recent
Fedora.  If you are not running S<Fedora 18+>, you will need to make changes
to your SELinux policy - contact us on the mailing list.

Once you have the requirements, do:

 ./configure --with-default-attach-method=libvirt
 make

Set SELinux to Enforcing mode, and sVirt should be used automatically.

All, or almost all, features of libguestfs should work under sVirt.  There
is one known shortcoming: L<virt-rescue(1)> will not use libvirt (hence
sVirt), but falls back to direct launch of qemu.  So you won't currently get
the benefit of sVirt protection when using virt-rescue.

You can check if sVirt is being used by enabling libvirtd logging (see
C</etc/libvirt/libvirtd.log>), killing and restarting libvirtd, and checking
the log files for S<"Setting SELinux context on ..."> messages.

In theory sVirt should support AppArmor, but we have not tried it.  It will
almost certainly require patching libvirt and writing an AppArmor policy.

=head2 Libguestfs has a really long list of dependencies!

That's because it does a lot of things.

=head2 How can I speed up libguestfs builds?

By far the most important thing you can do is to install and properly
configure Squid.  Note that the default configuration that ships with Squid
is rubbish, so configuring it is not optional.

A very good place to start with Squid configuration is here:
L<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras/MockTricks#Using_Squid_to_Speed_Up_Mock_package_downloads>

Make sure Squid is running, and that the environment variables
C<$http_proxy> and C<$ftp_proxy> are pointing to it.

With Squid running and correctly configured, appliance builds should be
reduced to a few minutes.

=head3 How can I speed up libguestfs builds (Debian)?

Hilko Bengen suggests using "approx" which is a Debian archive proxy
(L<http://packages.debian.org/approx>).  This tool is documented on Debian
in the approx(8) manual page.

=head1 SPEED, DISK SPACE USED BY LIBGUESTFS

Note: Most of the information in this section has moved:
L<guestfs-performance(1)>.

=head2 Upload or write seem very slow.

In libguestfs E<lt> 1.13.16, the mount command (L<guestfs(3)/guestfs_mount>)
enabled option C<-o sync> implicitly.  This causes very poor write
performance, and was one of the main gotchas for new libguestfs users.

For libguestfs E<lt> 1.13.16, replace mount with C<mount-options>, leaving
the first parameter as an empty string.

You can also do this with more recent versions of libguestfs, but if you
know that you are using libguestfs ≥ 1.13.16 then it's safe to use plain
mount.

If the underlying disk is not fully allocated (eg. sparse raw or qcow2) then
writes can be slow because the host operating system has to do costly disk
allocations while you are writing. The solution is to use a fully allocated
format instead, ie. non-sparse raw, or qcow2 with the
C<preallocation=metadata> option.

=head2 Libguestfs uses too much disk space!

libguestfs caches a large-ish appliance in:

 /var/tmp/.guestfs-<UID>

環境変数 C<TMPDIR> が定義されていると、代わりに C<$TMPDIR/.guestfs-E<lt>UIDE<gt>> が使用されます。

libguestfs を使用していないとき、このディレクトリーを安全に削除できます。

=head2 virt-sparsify は仮想ディスクの全容量までイメージを拡大します。

If the input to L<virt-sparsify(1)> is raw, then the output will be raw
sparse.  Make sure you are measuring the output with a tool which
understands sparseness such as C<du-sh>.  It can make a huge difference:

 $ ls -lh test1.img
 -rw-rw-r--. 1 rjones rjones 100M Aug  8 08:08 test1.img
 $ du -sh test1.img
 3.6M	test1.img

(見た目の容量 B<100M> と実際の容量 B<3.6M> を比較します)

If all this confuses you, use a non-sparse output by specifying the
I<--convert> option, eg:

 virt-sparsify --convert qcow2 disk.raw disk.qcow2

=head1 USING LIBGUESTFS IN YOUR OWN PROGRAMS

=head2 The API has hundreds of methods, where do I start?

We recommend you start by reading the API overview: L<guestfs(3)/API
OVERVIEW>.

Although the API overview covers the C API, it is still worth reading even
if you are going to use another programming language, because the API is the
same, just with simple logical changes to the names of the calls:

                  C  guestfs_ln_sf (g, target, linkname);
             Python  g.ln_sf (target, linkname);
              OCaml  g#ln_sf target linkname;
               Perl  $g->ln_sf (target, linkname);
  Shell (guestfish)  ln-sf target linkname
                PHP  guestfs_ln_sf ($g, $target, $linkname);

Once you're familiar with the API overview, you should look at this list of
starting points for other language bindings: L<guestfs(3)/USING LIBGUESTFS
WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES>.

=head2 Can I use libguestfs in my proprietary / closed source / commercial program?

In general, yes.  However this is not legal advice - read the license that
comes with libguestfs, and if you have specific questions contact a lawyer.

In the source tree the license is in the file C<COPYING.LIB> (LGPLv2+ for
the library and bindings) and C<COPYING> (GPLv2+ for the standalone
programs).

=head1 libguestfs のデバッグ

=head2 How do I debug when using any libguestfs program or tool (eg. virt-v2v or
virt-df)?

There are two C<LIBGUESTFS_*> environment variables you can set in order to
get more information from libguestfs.

=over 4

=item C<LIBGUESTFS_TRACE>

Set this to 1 and libguestfs will print out each command / API call in a
format which is similar to guestfish commands.

=item C<LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG>

Set this to 1 in order to enable massive amounts of debug messages.  If you
think there is some problem inside the libguestfs appliance, then you should
use this option.

=back

To set these from the shell, do this before running the program:

 export LIBGUESTFS_TRACE=1
 export LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1

For csh/tcsh the equivalent commands would be:

 setenv LIBGUESTFS_TRACE 1
 setenv LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG 1

詳細は L<guestfs(3)/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES> 参照。

=head2 How do I debug when using guestfish?

You can use the same environment variables above.  Alternatively use the
guestfish options -x (to trace commands) or -v (to get the full debug
output), or both.

詳細は L<guestfish(1)> を参照してください。

=head2 API を使用するとき、どのようにデバッグしますか?

Call L<guestfs(3)/guestfs_set_trace> to enable command traces, and/or
L<guestfs(3)/guestfs_set_verbose> to enable debug messages.

For best results, call these functions as early as possible, just after
creating the guestfs handle if you can, and definitely before calling
launch.

=head2 How do I capture debug output and put it into my logging system?

Use the event API.  For examples, see: L<guestfs(3)/SETTING CALLBACKS TO
HANDLE EVENTS>.

=head2 Digging deeper into the appliance boot process.

Enable debugging and then read this documentation on the appliance boot
process: L<guestfs(3)/INTERNALS>.

=head2 libguestfs hangs or fails during run/launch.

Enable debugging and look at the full output.  If you cannot work out what
is going on, file a bug report, including the I<complete> output of
L<libguestfs-test-tool(1)>.

=head1 DESIGN/INTERNALS OF LIBGUESTFS

=head2 Why don't you do everything through the FUSE / filesystem interface?

We offer a command called L<guestmount(1)> which lets you mount guest
filesystems on the host.  This is implemented as a FUSE module.  Why don't
we just implement the whole of libguestfs using this mechanism, instead of
having the large and rather complicated API?

The reasons are twofold.  Firstly, libguestfs offers API calls for doing
things like creating and deleting partitions and logical volumes, which
don't fit into a filesystem model very easily.  Or rather, you could fit
them in: for example, creating a partition could be mapped to C<mkdir
/fs/hda1> but then you'd have to specify some method to choose the size of
the partition (maybe C<echo 100M E<gt> /fs/hda1/.size>), and the partition
type, start and end sectors etc., but once you've done that the
filesystem-based API starts to look more complicated than the call-based API
we currently have.

The second reason is for efficiency.  FUSE itself is reasonably efficient,
but it does make lots of small, independent calls into the FUSE module.  In
guestmount these have to be translated into messages to the libguestfs
appliance which has a big overhead (in time and round trips).  For example,
reading a file in 64 KB chunks is inefficient because each chunk would turn
into a single round trip.  In the libguestfs API it is much more efficient
to download an entire file or directory through one of the streaming calls
like C<guestfs_download> or C<guestfs_tar_out>.

=head2 Why don't you do everything through GVFS?

The problems are similar to the problems with FUSE.

GVFS is a better abstraction than POSIX/FUSE.  There is an FTP backend for
GVFS, which is encouraging because FTP is conceptually similar to the
libguestfs API.  However the GVFS FTP backend makes multiple simultaneous
connections in order to keep interactivity, which we can't easily do with
libguestfs.

=head2 Can I use C<guestfish --ro> as a way to backup my virtual machines?

Usually this is not a good idea.  The question is answered in more detail in
this mailing list posting:
L<https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010-August/msg00024.html>

=head2 Why can I write to the disk, even though I added it read-only?

=head2 Why does C<--ro> appear to have no effect?

When you add a disk read-only, libguestfs places a writable overlay on top
of the underlying disk.  Writes go into this overlay, and are discarded when
the handle is closed (or C<guestfish> etc. exits).

There are two reasons for doing it this way: Firstly read-only disks aren't
possible in many cases (eg. IDE simply doesn't support them, so you couldn't
have an IDE-emulated read-only disk, although this is not common in real
libguestfs installations).

Secondly and more importantly, even if read-only disks were possible, you
wouldn't want them.  Mounting any filesystem that has a journal, even
C<mount -o ro>, causes writes to the filesystem because the journal has to
be replayed and metadata updated.  If the disk was truly read-only, you
wouldn't be able to mount a dirty filesystem.

To make it usable, we create the overlay as a place to temporarily store
these writes, and then we discard it afterwards.  This ensures that the
underlying disk is always untouched.

Note also that there is a regression test for this when building libguestfs
(in C<tests/qemu>).  This is one reason why it's important for packagers to
run the test suite.

=head2 C<--ro> はすべてのディスクを読み込み専用にしますか?

I<いいえ!> C<--ro> オプションはコマンドラインにおいて、つまり C<-a> および C<-d>
オプションを使用して追加されたディスクのみに影響します。

In guestfish, if you use the C<add> command, then disk is added read-write
(unless you specify the C<readonly:true> flag explicitly with the command).

=head2 guestfish と virt-rescue の違いは何でしょうか?

多くの人々が私たちの提供している 2 つの似たツールにより混乱しています:

 $ guestfish --ro -a guest.img
 ><fs> run
 ><fs> fsck /dev/sda1

 $ virt-rescue --ro guest.img
 ><rescue> /sbin/fsck /dev/sda1

And the related question which then arises is why you can't type in full
shell commands with all the --options in guestfish (but you can in
L<virt-rescue(1)>).

L<guestfish(1)> is a program providing structured access to the
L<guestfs(3)> API.  It happens to be a nice interactive shell too, but its
primary purpose is structured access from shell scripts.  Think of it more
like a language binding, like Python and other bindings, but for shell.  The
key differentiating factor of guestfish (and the libguestfs API in general)
is the ability to automate changes.

L<virt-rescue(1)> is a free-for-all freeform way to boot the libguestfs
appliance and make arbitrary changes to your VM. It's not structured, you
can't automate it, but for making quick ad-hoc fixes to your guests, it can
be quite useful.

But, libguestfs also has a "backdoor" into the appliance allowing you to
send arbitrary shell commands.  It's not as flexible as virt-rescue, because
you can't interact with the shell commands, but here it is anyway:

 ><fs> debug sh "cmd arg1 arg2 ..."

Note that you should B<not> rely on this.  It could be removed or changed in
future. If your program needs some operation, please add it to the
libguestfs API instead.

=head2 What's the deal with C<guestfish -i>?

=head2 Why does virt-cat only work on a real VM image, but virt-df works on any
disk image?

=head2 What does "no root device found in this operating system image" mean?

These questions are all related at a fundamental level which may not be
immediately obvious.

At the L<guestfs(3)> API level, a "disk image" is just a pile of partitions
and filesystems.

In contrast, when the virtual machine boots, it mounts those filesystems
into a consistent hierarchy such as:

 /          (/dev/sda2)
 |
 +-- /boot  (/dev/sda1)
 |
 +-- /home  (/dev/vg_external/Homes)
 |
 +-- /usr   (/dev/vg_os/lv_usr)
 |
 +-- /var   (/dev/vg_os/lv_var)

(または Windows におけるドライブレター)。

The API first of all sees the disk image at the "pile of filesystems"
level.  But it also has a way to inspect the disk image to see if it
contains an operating system, and how the disks are mounted when the
operating system boots: L<guestfs(3)/INSPECTION>.

Users expect some tools (like L<virt-cat(1)>) to work with VM paths:

 virt-cat fedora.img /var/log/messages

How does virt-cat know that C</var> is a separate partition? The trick is
that virt-cat performs inspection on the disk image, and uses that to
translate the path correctly.

Some tools (including L<virt-cat(1)>, L<virt-edit(1)>, L<virt-ls(1)>)  use
inspection to map VM paths.  Other tools, such as L<virt-df(1)> and
L<virt-filesystems(1)> operate entirely at the raw "big pile of filesystems"
level of the libguestfs API, and don't use inspection.

L<guestfish(1)> is in an interesting middle ground.  If you use the I<-a>
and I<-m> command line options, then you have to tell guestfish exactly how
to add disk images and where to mount partitions. This is the raw API level.

If you use the I<-i> option, libguestfs performs inspection and mounts the
filesystems for you.

The error C<no root device found in this operating system image> is related
to this.  It means inspection was unable to locate an operating system
within the disk image you gave it.  You might see this from programs like
virt-cat if you try to run them on something which is just a disk image, not
a virtual machine disk image.

=head2 What do these C<debug*> and C<internal-*> functions do?

There are some functions which are used for debugging and internal purposes
which are I<not> part of the stable API.

The C<debug*> (or C<guestfs_debug*>) functions, primarily
L<guestfs(3)/guestfs_debug> and a handful of others, are used for debugging
libguestfs.  Although they are not part of the stable API and thus may
change or be removed at any time, some programs may want to call these while
waiting for features to be added to libguestfs.

The C<internal-*> (or C<guestfs_internal_*>) functions are purely to be used
by libguestfs itself.  There is no reason for programs to call them, and
programs should not try to use them.  Using them will often cause bad things
to happen, as well as not being part of the documented stable API.
