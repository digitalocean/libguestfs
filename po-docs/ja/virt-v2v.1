Virt\-v2v converts a single guest from a foreign hypervisor to run on \s-1KVM.\s0
It can read Linux and Windows guests running on VMware, Xen, Hyper-V and
some other hypervisors, and convert them to \s-1KVM\s0 managed by libvirt,
OpenStack, oVirt, Red Hat Virtualisation (\s-1RHV\s0) or several other targets.  It
can modify the guest to make it bootable on \s-1KVM\s0 and install virtio drivers
so it will run quickly.
.PP
There is also a companion front-end called \fBvirt\-p2v\fR\|(1) which comes as an
\&\s-1ISO, CD\s0 or \s-1PXE\s0 image that can be booted on physical machines to virtualize
those machines (physical to virtual, or p2v).
.SS "Input and Output"
.IX Subsection "Input and Output"
You normally run virt\-v2v with several \fI\-i*\fR options controlling the input
mode and also several \fI\-o*\fR options controlling the output mode.  In this
sense, \*(L"input\*(R" refers to the source foreign hypervisor such as VMware, and
\&\*(L"output\*(R" refers to the target KVM-based management system such as oVirt or
OpenStack.
.PP
The input and output sides of virt\-v2v are separate and unrelated.  Virt\-v2v
can read from any input and write to any output.  Therefore these sides of
virt\-v2v are documented separately in this manual.
.PP
Virt\-v2v normally copies from the input to the output, called \*(L"copying
mode\*(R".  In this case the source guest is always left unchanged.  In-place
conversion (\fI\-\-in\-place\fR) only uses the \fI\-i*\fR options and modifies the
source guest in-place.  (See \*(L"In-place conversion\*(R" below.)

.SS "Convert from VMware vCenter server to local libvirt"
.IX Subsection "Convert from VMware vCenter server to local libvirt"
You have a VMware vCenter server called \f(CW\*(C`vcenter.example.com\*(C'\fR, a datacenter
called \f(CW\*(C`Datacenter\*(C'\fR, and an ESXi hypervisor called \f(CW\*(C`esxi\*(C'\fR.  You want to
convert a guest called \f(CW\*(C`vmware_guest\*(C'\fR to run locally under libvirt.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v \-ic vpx://vcenter.example.com/Datacenter/esxi vmware_guest
.Ve
.PP
In this case you will most likely have to run virt\-v2v as \f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR, since it
needs to talk to the system libvirt daemon and copy the guest disks to
\&\fI/var/lib/libvirt/images\fR.
.PP
For more information see \fBvirt\-v2v\-input\-vmware\fR\|(1).
.SS "Convert from VMware to RHV/oVirt"
.IX Subsection "Convert from VMware to RHV/oVirt"
This is the same as the previous example, except you want to send the guest
to a \s-1RHV\s0 Data Domain using the \s-1RHV REST API.\s0  Guest network interface(s) are
connected to the target network called \f(CW\*(C`ovirtmgmt\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 5
\& virt\-v2v \-ic vpx://vcenter.example.com/Datacenter/esxi vmware_guest \e
\&   \-o rhv\-upload \-oc https://ovirt\-engine.example.com/ovirt\-engine/api \e

\&   \-oo rhv\-cafile=/tmp/ca.pem \-oo rhv\-direct \e
\&   \-\-bridge ovirtmgmt
.Ve
.PP
In this case the host running virt\-v2v acts as a \fBconversion server\fR.
.PP

.SS "Convert from ESXi hypervisor over \s-1SSH\s0 to local libvirt"
.IX Subsection "Convert from ESXi hypervisor over SSH to local libvirt"
You have an ESXi hypervisor called \f(CW\*(C`esxi.example.com\*(C'\fR with \s-1SSH\s0 access
enabled.  You want to convert from \s-1VMFS\s0 storage on that server to a local
file.
.PP
.Vb 4
\& virt\-v2v \e
\&   \-i vmx \-it ssh \e
\&   "ssh://root@esxi.example.com/vmfs/volumes/datastore1/guest/guest.vmx" \e
\&   \-o local \-os /var/tmp
.Ve
.PP
The guest must not be running.  Virt\-v2v would \fInot\fR need to be run as root
in this case.
.PP
For more information about converting from \s-1VMX\s0 files see
\&\fBvirt\-v2v\-input\-vmware\fR\|(1).
.SS "Convert disk image to OpenStack"
.IX Subsection "Convert disk image to OpenStack"
Given a disk image from another hypervisor that you want to convert to run
on OpenStack (only KVM-based OpenStack is supported), you can run virt\-v2v
inside an OpenStack \s-1VM\s0 (called \f(CW\*(C`v2v\-vm\*(C'\fR below), and do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v \-i disk disk.img \-o openstack \-oo server\-id=v2v\-vm
.Ve
.PP
See \fBvirt\-v2v\-output\-openstack\fR\|(1).
.SS "Convert disk image to disk image"
.IX Subsection "Convert disk image to disk image"
Given a disk image from another hypervisor that you want to convert to run
on \s-1KVM,\s0 you have two options.  The simplest way is to try:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v \-i disk disk.img \-o local \-os /var/tmp
.Ve
.PP
where virt\-v2v guesses everything about the input \fIdisk.img\fR and (in this
case) writes the converted result to \fI/var/tmp\fR.
.PP
A more complex method is to write some libvirt
\&\s-1XML\s0 describing the input guest (if you
can get the source hypervisor to provide you with libvirt \s-1XML,\s0 then so much
the better).  You can then do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v \-i libvirtxml guest\-domain.xml \-o local \-os /var/tmp
.Ve
.PP
Since \fIguest\-domain.xml\fR contains the path(s) to the guest disk image(s)
you do not need to specify the name of the disk image on the command line.
.PP
To convert a local disk image and immediately boot it in local qemu, do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v \-i disk disk.img \-o qemu \-os /var/tmp \-\-qemu\-boot

.IP "\fB\-\-echo\-keys\fR" 4
.IX Item "--echo-keys"
When prompting for keys and passphrases, virt\-v2v normally turns echoing off
so you cannot see what you are typing.  If you are not worried about Tempest
attacks and there is no one else in the room you can specify this flag to
see what you are typing.
.Sp
Note this options only applies to keys and passphrases for encrypted devices
and partitions, not for passwords used to connect to remote servers.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fBdisk\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i disk"
Set the input method to \fIdisk\fR.
.Sp
In this mode you can read a virtual machine disk image with no metadata.
virt\-v2v tries to guess the best default metadata.  This is usually adequate
but you can get finer control (eg. of memory and vCPUs) by using \fI\-i
libvirtxml\fR instead.  Only guests that use a single disk can be imported
this way.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fBlibvirt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i libvirt"
Set the input method to \fIlibvirt\fR.  This is the default.
.Sp
In this mode you have to specify a libvirt guest name or \s-1UUID\s0 on the command
line.  You may also specify a libvirt connection \s-1URI\s0 (see \fI\-ic\fR).
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fBlibvirtxml\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i libvirtxml"
Set the input method to \fIlibvirtxml\fR.
.Sp
In this mode you have to pass a libvirt \s-1XML\s0 file on the command line.  This
file is read in order to get metadata about the source guest (such as its
name, amount of memory), and also to locate the input disks.  See \*(L"Minimal
\&\s-1XML\s0 for \-i libvirtxml option\*(R" below.

.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fBova\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i ova"
Set the input method to \fIova\fR.
.Sp
In this mode you can read a VMware ova file.  Virt\-v2v will read the ova
manifest file and check the vmdk volumes for validity (checksums)  as well
as analyzing the ovf file, and then convert the guest.  See
\&\fBvirt\-v2v\-input\-vmware\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-i\fR \fBvmx\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i vmx"
Set the input method to \fIvmx\fR.

In this mode you can read a VMware vmx file directly or over \s-1SSH.\s0  This is
useful when VMware VMs are stored on an \s-1NFS\s0 server which you can mount
directly, or where you have access by \s-1SSH\s0 to an ESXi hypervisor.  See

The \s-1NFS\s0 export must be mountable and writable by the user and host running

When using this option you must specify an output mode.  This is because
virt\-v2v has to perform the conversion in order to print the estimate, and

Choose the root filesystem to be converted.
.Sp
In the case where the virtual machine is dual-boot or multi-boot, or where
the \s-1VM\s0 has other filesystems that look like operating systems, this option
can be used to select the root filesystem (a.k.a. \f(CW\*(C`C:\*(C'\fR drive or \fI/\fR) of
the operating system that is to be converted.  The Windows Recovery Console,
certain attached \s-1DVD\s0 drives, and bugs in libguestfs inspection heuristics,
can make a guest look like a multi-boot operating system.
.Sp
The default in virt\-v2v ≤ 0.7.1 was \fI\-\-root single\fR, which causes
virt\-v2v to die if a multi-boot operating system is found.
.Sp
Since virt\-v2v ≥ 0.7.2 the default is now \fI\-\-root ask\fR: If the \s-1VM\s0 is
found to be multi-boot, then virt\-v2v will stop and list the possible root
filesystems and ask the user which to use.  This requires that virt\-v2v is
run interactively.
.Sp
\&\fI\-\-root first\fR means to choose the first root device in the case of a
multi-boot operating system.  Since this is a heuristic, it may sometimes
choose the wrong one.
.Sp
You can also name a specific root device, eg. \fI\-\-root /dev/sda2\fR would
mean to use the second partition on the first hard drive.  If the named root
device does not exist or was not detected as a root device, then virt\-v2v
will fail.
.Sp
Note that there is a bug in grub which prevents it from successfully booting
a multiboot system if virtio is enabled.  Grub is only able to boot an
operating system from the first virtio disk.  Specifically, \fI/boot\fR must be
on the first virtio disk, and it cannot chainload an \s-1OS\s0 which is not in the
first virtio disk.

\fIOpenStack and Windows reactivation\fR
.IX Subsection "OpenStack and Windows reactivation"
.PP
OpenStack does not offer stable device / \s-1PCI\s0 addresses to guests.  Every
time it creates or starts a guest, it regenerates the libvirt \s-1XML\s0 for that
guest from scratch.  The libvirt \s-1XML\s0 will have no <address> fields.
Libvirt will then assign addresses to devices, in a predictable manner.
Addresses may change if any of the following are true:
.IP "\(bu" 4
A new disk or network device has been added or removed from the guest.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The version of OpenStack or (possibly) libvirt has changed.
.PP
Because Windows does not like \*(L"hardware\*(R" changes of this kind, it may
trigger Windows reactivation.
.PP
This can also prevent booting with a 7B error [see previous section] if the
guest has group policy containing \f(CW\*(C`Device Installation Restrictions\*(C'\fR.

\fISupport for \s-1SHA\-2\s0 certificates in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2\fR
.IX Subsection "Support for SHA-2 certificates in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2"
.PP
Later versions of the Windows virtio drivers are signed using \s-1SHA\-2\s0
certificates (instead of \s-1SHA\-1\s0).  The original shipping Windows 7 and
Windows Server 2008 R2 did not understand \s-1SHA\-2\s0 certificates and so the
Windows virtio drivers will not install properly.
.PP
To fix this you must apply \s-1SHA\-2\s0 Code Signing Support from:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en\-us/security\-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2015/3033929
before converting the guest.
.PP

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1624878
.SS "Networks and bridges"
.IX Subsection "Networks and bridges"
Guests are usually connected to one or more networks, and when converted to
the target hypervisor you usually want to reconnect those networks at the
destination.  The options \fI\-\-network\fR, \fI\-\-bridge\fR and \fI\-\-mac\fR allow you
to do that.
.PP
If you are unsure of what networks and bridges are in use on the source
hypervisor, then you can examine the source metadata (libvirt \s-1XML,\s0 vCenter
information, etc.).  Or you can run virt\-v2v with the \fI\-\-print\-source\fR
option which causes virt\-v2v to print out the information it has about the
guest on the source and then exit.
.PP
In the \fI\-\-print\-source\fR output you will see a section showing the guest’s
Network Interface Cards (NICs):
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ virt\-v2v [\-i ...] \-\-print\-source name
\& [...]
\& NICs:
\&     Network "default" mac: 52:54:00:d0:cf:0e
.Ve
.PP
Bridges are special classes of network devices which are attached to a named
external network on the source hypervisor, for example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& $ virt\-v2v [\-i ...] \-\-print\-source name
\& [...]
\& NICs:
\&     Bridge "br0"
.Ve
.PP
To map a specific source bridge to a target network, for example \f(CW\*(C`br0\*(C'\fR on
the source to \f(CW\*(C`ovirtmgmt\*(C'\fR on the target, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v [...] \-\-bridge br0:ovirtmgmt
.Ve
.PP
To map every bridge to a target network, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v [...] \-\-bridge ovirtmgmt
.Ve
.PP
\fIFine-grained mapping of guest NICs\fR
.IX Subsection "Fine-grained mapping of guest NICs"
.PP
The \fI\-\-mac\fR option gives you more control over the mapping, letting you map
single NICs to either networks or bridges on the target.  For example a
source guest with two NICs could map them individually to two networks
called \f(CW\*(C`mgmt\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`clientdata\*(C'\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& $ virt\-v2v [...] \e
\&    \-\-mac 52:54:00:d0:cf:0e:network:mgmt \e
\&    \-\-mac 52:54:00:d0:cf:0f:network:clientdata
.Ve
.PP
Note that virt\-v2v does not have the ability to change a guest’s \s-1MAC\s0
address.  The \s-1MAC\s0 address is part of the guest metadata and must remain the
same on source and target hypervisors.  Most guests will use the \s-1MAC\s0 address
to set up persistent associations between NICs and internal names (like
\&\f(CW\*(C`eth0\*(C'\fR), with firewall settings, or even for other purposes like software
licensing.
.SS "Resource requirements"
.IX Subsection "Resource requirements"
\fINetwork\fR
.IX Subsection "Network"
.PP
The most important resource for virt\-v2v appears to be network bandwidth.
Virt\-v2v should be able to copy guest data at gigabit ethernet speeds or
greater.
.PP
Ensure that the network connections between servers (conversion server, \s-1NFS\s0
server, vCenter, Xen) are as fast and as low latency as possible.
.PP
\fIDisk space\fR
.IX Subsection "Disk space"
.PP
Virt\-v2v places potentially large temporary files in \f(CW$TMPDIR\fR (which is
\&\fI/var/tmp\fR if you don't set it).  Using tmpfs is a bad idea.
.PP
For each guest disk, an overlay is stored temporarily.  This stores the
changes made during conversion, and is used as a cache.  The overlays are
not particularly large \- tens or low hundreds of megabytes per disk is
typical.  In addition to the overlay(s), input and output methods may use
disk space, as outlined in the table below.
.IP "\fI\-i ova\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i ova"
This temporarily places a full copy of the uncompressed source disks in
\&\f(CW$TMPDIR\fR.
.IP "\fI\-o glance\fR" 4

This temporarily places a full copy of the output disks in \f(CW$TMPDIR\fR.
.IP "\fI\-o local\fR" 4

You must ensure there is sufficient space in the output directory for the
converted guest.
.PP
See also \*(L"Minimum free space check in the host\*(R" below.
.PP
\fIVMware vCenter resources\fR
.IX Subsection "VMware vCenter resources"
.PP
Copying from VMware vCenter is currently quite slow, but we believe this to
be an issue with VMware.  Ensuring the VMware ESXi hypervisor and vCenter
are running on fast hardware with plenty of memory should alleviate this.
.PP
\fICompute power and \s-1RAM\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "Compute power and RAM"
.PP
Virt\-v2v is not especially compute or \s-1RAM\s0 intensive.  If you are running
many parallel conversions, then you may consider allocating one \s-1CPU\s0 core and
2 \s-1GB\s0 of \s-1RAM\s0 per running instance.
.PP
Virt\-v2v can be run in a virtual machine.
.PP
\fITrimming\fR
.IX Subsection "Trimming"
.PP
Virt\-v2v attempts to optimize the speed of conversion by ignoring guest
filesystem data which is not used.  This would include unused filesystem
blocks, blocks containing zeroes, and deleted files.
.PP
To do this, virt\-v2v issues a non-destructive \fBfstrim\fR\|(8) operation.  As
this happens to an overlay placed over the guest data, it does \fBnot\fR affect
the source in any way.
.PP
If this fstrim operation fails, you will see a warning, but virt\-v2v will
continue anyway.  It may run more slowly (in some cases much more slowly),
because it is copying the unused parts of the disk.
.PP
Unfortunately support for fstrim is not universal, and it also depends on
specific details of the filesystem, partition alignment, and backing
storage.  As an example, \s-1NTFS\s0 filesystems cannot be fstrimmed if they occupy
a partition which is not aligned to the underlying storage.  That was the
default on Windows before Vista.  As another example, \s-1VFAT\s0 filesystems (used
by \s-1UEFI\s0 guests) cannot be trimmed at all.
.PP
fstrim support in the Linux kernel is improving gradually, so over time some
of these restrictions will be lifted and virt\-v2v will work faster.
.SS "Post-conversion tasks"
.IX Subsection "Post-conversion tasks"
\fIGuest network configuration\fR
.IX Subsection "Guest network configuration"
.PP
Virt\-v2v cannot currently reconfigure a guest’s network configuration.  If
the converted guest is not connected to the same subnet as the source, its
network configuration may have to be updated.  See also
\&\fBvirt\-customize\fR\|(1).
.PP
\fIConverting a Windows guest\fR
.IX Subsection "Converting a Windows guest"
.PP
When converting a Windows guests, the conversion process is split into two
stages:
.IP "1." 4
Offline conversion.
.IP "2." 4
First boot.
.PP
The guest will be bootable after the offline conversion stage, but will not
yet have all necessary drivers installed to work correctly.  These will be
installed automatically the first time the guest boots.
.PP
\&\fBN.B.\fR Take care not to interrupt the automatic driver installation process
when logging in to the guest for the first time, as this may prevent the
guest from subsequently booting correctly.
.SS "Free space for conversion"
.IX Subsection "Free space for conversion"
\fIFree space in the guest\fR
.IX Subsection "Free space in the guest"
.PP
Virt\-v2v checks there is sufficient free space in the guest filesystem to
perform the conversion.  Currently it checks:
.ie n .IP "Linux root filesystem or Windows ""C:"" drive" 4
.el .IP "Linux root filesystem or Windows \f(CWC:\fR drive" 4
.IX Item "Linux root filesystem or Windows C: drive"
Minimum free space: 20 \s-1MB\s0
.IP "Linux \fI/boot\fR" 4
.IX Item "Linux /boot"
Minimum free space: 50 \s-1MB\s0
.Sp
This is because we need to build a new initramfs for some Enterprise Linux
conversions.
.IP "Any other mountable filesystem" 4
.IX Item "Any other mountable filesystem"
Minimum free space: 10 \s-1MB\s0
.PP
\fIMinimum free space check in the host\fR
.IX Subsection "Minimum free space check in the host"
.PP
You must have sufficient free space in the host directory used to store
temporary overlays (except in \fI\-\-in\-place\fR mode).  To find out which
directory this is, use:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& $ df \-h "\`guestfish get\-cachedir\`"
\& Filesystem        Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
\& /dev/mapper/root   50G   40G  6.8G  86% /
.Ve
.PP
and look under the \f(CW\*(C`Avail\*(C'\fR column.  Virt\-v2v will refuse to do the
conversion at all unless at least 1GB is available there.
.PP
See also \*(L"Resource requirements\*(R" above.
.SS "Running virt\-v2v as root or non-root"
.IX Subsection "Running virt-v2v as root or non-root"
Nothing in virt\-v2v inherently needs root access, and it will run just fine
as a non-root user.  However, certain external features may require either
root or a special user:
.IP "Mounting the Export Storage Domain" 4
.IX Item "Mounting the Export Storage Domain"
When using \fI\-o rhv \-os server:/esd\fR virt\-v2v has to have sufficient
privileges to \s-1NFS\s0 mount the Export Storage Domain from \f(CW\*(C`server\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can avoid needing root here by mounting it yourself before running
virt\-v2v, and passing \fI\-os /mountpoint\fR instead, but first of all read the
next section ...
.IP "Writing to the Export Storage Domain as 36:36" 4
.IX Item "Writing to the Export Storage Domain as 36:36"
RHV-M cannot read files and directories from the Export Storage Domain
unless they have \s-1UID:GID 36:36.\s0  You will see \s-1VM\s0 import problems if the
\&\s-1UID:GID\s0 is not correct.
.Sp
When you run virt\-v2v \fI\-o rhv\fR as root, virt\-v2v attempts to create files
and directories with the correct ownership.  If you run virt\-v2v as
non-root, it will probably still work, but you will need to manually change
ownership after virt\-v2v has finished.
.IP "Writing to libvirt" 4
.IX Item "Writing to libvirt"
When using \fI\-o libvirt\fR, you may need to run virt\-v2v as root so that it
can write to the libvirt system instance (ie. \f(CW\*(C`qemu:///system\*(C'\fR)  and to the
default location for disk images (usually \fI/var/lib/libvirt/images\fR).
.Sp
You can avoid this by setting up libvirt connection authentication, see
http://libvirt.org/auth.html.  Alternatively, use \fI\-oc qemu:///session\fR,
which will write to your per-user libvirt instance.
.IP "Writing to Openstack" 4
.IX Item "Writing to Openstack"
Because of how Cinder volumes are presented as \fI/dev\fR block devices, using
\&\fI\-o openstack\fR normally requires that virt\-v2v is run as root.
.IP "Writing to Glance" 4
.IX Item "Writing to Glance"
This does \fInot\fR need root (in fact it probably won’t work), but may require
either a special user and/or for you to source a script that sets
authentication environment variables.  Consult the Glance documentation.
.SS "Minimal \s-1XML\s0 for \-i libvirtxml option"

.SS "In-place conversion"
.IX Subsection "In-place conversion"
It is also possible to use virt\-v2v in scenarios where a foreign \s-1VM\s0 has
already been imported into a KVM-based hypervisor, but still needs
adjustments in the guest to make it run in the new virtual hardware.
.PP
In that case it is assumed that a third-party tool has created the target \s-1VM\s0
in the supported KVM-based hypervisor based on the source \s-1VM\s0 configuration
and contents, but using virtual devices more appropriate for \s-1KVM\s0
(e.g. virtio storage and network, etc.).
.PP
Then, to make the guest \s-1OS\s0 boot and run in the changed environment, one can
use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-v2v \-ic qemu:///system converted_vm \-\-in\-place
.Ve
.PP
Virt\-v2v will analyze the configuration of \f(CW\*(C`converted_vm\*(C'\fR in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`qemu:///system\*(C'\fR libvirt instance, and apply various fixups to the guest \s-1OS\s0
configuration to make it match the \s-1VM\s0 configuration.  This may include
installing virtio drivers, configuring the bootloader, the mountpoints, the
network interfaces, and so on.
.PP
Should an error occur during the operation, virt\-v2v exits with an error
code leaving the \s-1VM\s0 in an undefined state.
.SS "Machine readable output"
.IX Subsection "Machine readable output"
The \fI\-\-machine\-readable\fR option can be used to make the output more machine
friendly, which is useful when calling virt\-v2v from other programs, GUIs
etc.
.PP
このオプションを使用するには 2 通りの方法があります。
.PP
Firstly use the option on its own to query the capabilities of the virt\-v2v
binary.  Typical output looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 11
\& $ virt\-v2v \-\-machine\-readable
\& virt\-v2v
\& libguestfs\-rewrite
\& colours\-option
\& vdsm\-compat\-option
\& input:disk
\& [...]
\& output:local
\& [...]
\& convert:linux
\& convert:windows
.Ve
.PP
A list of features is printed, one per line, and the program exits with
status 0.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`input:\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`output:\*(C'\fR features refer to \fI\-i\fR and \fI\-o\fR (input and
output mode) options supported by this binary.  The \f(CW\*(C`convert:\*(C'\fR features
refer to guest types that this binary knows how to convert.
.PP
Secondly use the option in conjunction with other options to make the
regular program output more machine friendly.
.PP
At the moment this means:
.IP "1." 4
Progress bar messages can be parsed from stdout by looking for this regular
expression:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& ^[0\-9]+/[0\-9]+$
.Ve
.IP "2." 4
The calling program should treat messages sent to stdout (except for
progress bar messages) as status messages.  They can be logged and/or
displayed to the user.
.IP "3." 4
The calling program should treat messages sent to stderr as error messages.
In addition, virt\-v2v exits with a non-zero status code if there was a fatal
error.
.PP
Virt\-v2v ≤ 0.9.1 did not support the \fI\-\-machine\-readable\fR option at
all.  The option was added when virt\-v2v was rewritten in 2014.
