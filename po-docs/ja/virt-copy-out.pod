image or named libvirt domain.

=head1 JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH

This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the
L<guestfish(1)> C<copy-out> command.  For anything more complex than a
trivial copy, you are probably better off using guestfish directly.

=head1 オプション

Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read
L<guestfish(1)> to see the full list of options.
