=encoding utf8

=item B<--firstboot> SCRIPT (see C<firstboot> below)

Run script(s) once next time the guest boots.  You can supply the
I<--firstboot> option as many times as needed.

=item B<--hostname> HOSTNAME (see C<hostname> below)

ホスト名を変更します。指定されないと、デフォルトで C<localhost.localdomain> になります。

=item B<--password> USERNAME:SELECTOR (see C<password> below)

Set a user password.  The user must exist already (this option does I<not>
create users).

The I<--password> option takes C<USERNAME:SELECTOR>.  The I<--root-password>
option takes just the C<SELECTOR>.  The format of the C<SELECTOR> is
described below:

=over 4

=item B<--password USERNAME:file:FILENAME>

=item B<--root-password file:FILENAME>

Read the password from C<FILENAME>.  The whole first line of this file is
the replacement password.  Any other lines are ignored.  You should create
the file with mode 0600 to ensure no one else can read it.

=item B<--password USERNAME:password:PASSWORD>

=item B<--root-password password:PASSWORD>

Set the password to the literal string C<PASSWORD>.

B<Note: this is not secure> since any user on the same machine can see the
cleartext password using L<ps(1)>.

=back

=item B<--password-crypto> md5|sha256|sha512 (see C<password> below)

Set the password encryption to C<md5>, C<sha256> or C<sha512>.

C<sha256> and C<sha512> require glibc E<ge> 2.7 (check L<crypt(3)> inside
the guest).

C<md5> will work with relatively old Linux guests (eg. RHEL 3), but is not
secure against modern attacks.

The default is C<sha512> unless libguestfs detects an old guest that didn't
have support for SHA-512, in which case it will use C<md5>.  You can
override libguestfs by specifying this option.

=item B<--root-password> SELECTOR (see C<password> below)

Set the root password.  See I<--password> above for the format of
C<SELECTOR>.

=item B<--script> SCRIPT (see C<script> below)

Run the named C<SCRIPT> (a shell script or program) against the guest.  The
script can be any program on the host.  The script's current directory will
be the guest's root directory.

B<Note:> If the script is not on the $PATH, then you must give the full
absolute path to the script.

=item B<--scriptdir> SCRIPTDIR (see C<script> below)

The mount point (an empty directory on the host) used when the C<script>
operation is enabled and one or more scripts are specified using I<--script>
parameter(s).

B<Note:> C<SCRIPTDIR> B<must> be an absolute path.

If I<--scriptdir> is not specified then a temporary mountpoint will be
created.
