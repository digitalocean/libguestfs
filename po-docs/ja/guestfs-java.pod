guestfs-java - How to use libguestfs from Java

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 import com.redhat.et.libguestfs.*;
 
 GuestFS g = new GuestFS ();
 g.add_drive_opts ("disk.img", null);
 g.launch ();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page documents how to call libguestfs from the Java programming
language.  This page just documents the differences from the C API and gives
some examples.  If you are not familiar with using libguestfs, you also need
to read L<guestfs(3)>.

=head2 CLOSING THE HANDLE

The handle is closed when it is reaped by the garbage collector.  Because
libguestfs handles include a lot of state, it is also possible to close (and
hence free) them explicitly by calling the C<close> method.

=head2 EXCEPTIONS

Errors from libguestfs functions are mapped into the C<LibGuestFSException>
exception.  This has a single parameter which is the error message (a
C<String>).

Calling any method on a closed handle raises the same exception.
