.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
.Vb 1
\& libguestfs\-test\-tool [\-\-options]
.Ve
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
libguestfs-test-tool is a test program shipped with libguestfs to allow you
to check basic libguestfs functionality is working.  This is needed because
libguestfs occasionally breaks for reasons beyond our control: usually
because of changes in the underlying qemu or kernel packages, or the host
environment.
.PP
If you suspect a problem in libguestfs, then just run:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& libguestfs\-test\-tool
.Ve
.PP
It will print lots of diagnostic messages.
.PP
If it runs to completion successfully, you will see this near the end:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ===== TEST FINISHED OK =====
.Ve
.PP
and the test tool will exit with code 0.
.PP
If it fails (and/or exits with non-zero error code), please paste the
\&\fIcomplete, unedited\fR output of the test tool into a bug report.  More
information about reporting bugs can be found on the
<http://libguestfs.org/> website.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Display short usage information and exit.
.IP "\fB\-\-qemu qemu_binary\fR" 4
.IX Item "--qemu qemu_binary"
If you have downloaded another qemu binary, point this option at the full
path of the binary to try it.
.IP "\fB\-\-qemudir qemu_source_dir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--qemudir qemu_source_dir"
If you have compiled qemu from source, point this option at the source
directory to try it.
.IP "\fB\-t N\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t N"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-timeout N\fR" 4
.IX Item "--timeout N"
.PD
Set the launch timeout to \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR seconds.  The default is 600 seconds (10
minutes) which does not usually need to be adjusted.
.SH "TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF QEMU"
.IX Header "TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT VERSION OF QEMU"
If you have compiled another version of qemu from source and would like to
try that, then you can use the \fI\-\-qemudir\fR option to point to the qemu
source directory.
.PP
If you have downloaded a qemu binary from somewhere, use the \fI\-\-qemu\fR
option to point to the binary.
.PP
Note when using these options, you can ignore the business of qemu wrapper
scripts (\*(L"\s-1QEMU\s0 \s-1WRAPPERS\s0\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3)), since libguestfs-test-tool writes a
wrapper script for you if one is needed.
.SH "TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT KERNEL"
.IX Header "TRYING OUT A DIFFERENT KERNEL"
If you are using febootstrap ≥ 3.8 then you can select which kernel
libguestfs tries.  You do this by setting the environment variables
\&\f(CW\*(C`FEBOOTSTRAP_KERNEL\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`FEBOOTSTRAP_MODULES\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Refer to \*(L"\s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0 \s-1VARIABLES\s0\*(R" in \fIfebootstrap\-supermin\-helper\fR\|(8) for further
information.
.SH "SELF-DIAGNOSIS"
.IX Header "SELF-DIAGNOSIS"
Refer to \*(L"\s-1APPLIANCE\s0 \s-1BOOT\s0 \s-1PROCESS\s0\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) to understand the messages
produced by libguestfs-test-tool and/or possible errors.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
libguestfs-test-tool returns \fI0\fR if the tests completed without error, or
\&\fI1\fR if there was an error.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"

please see the \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) manual page.
