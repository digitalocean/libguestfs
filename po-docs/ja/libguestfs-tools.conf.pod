/etc/libguestfs-tools.conf - configuration file for guestfish, guestmount,
virt-rescue

=head1 書式

 /etc/libguestfs-tools.conf

 $HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc

=head1 説明

C</etc/libguestfs-tools.conf> or C<$HOME/.libguestfs-tools.rc> changes the
defaults for the following programs only:

=over 4

=item *

L<guestfish(1)>

=item *

L<guestmount(1)>

=item *

L<virt-rescue(1)>

=back

There is currently only one setting which is controlled by this file.
Adding (or uncommenting):

 read_only = true;

changes these programs so they act as if the I<--ro> flag was given on the
command line.  You can use this to make the programs safe against accidental
modification of a live guest (users would have to explicitly add the I<--rw>
flag to modify guests).  This is not the default because it is not backwards
compatible.  See also L<guestfish(1)/OPENING DISKS FOR READ AND WRITE>.

Note that B<the semicolon is required>.

C</etc/libguestfs-tools.conf> is the global configuration file for all of
the above programs.  Local users can override the global configuration by
copying this file into C<.libguestfs-tools.rc> in their home directory and
modifying it accordingly.

This file is parsed by the libconfig library.  For more information about
the format, see:
