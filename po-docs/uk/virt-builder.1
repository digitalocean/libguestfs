Virt-builder is a tool for quickly building new virtual machines.  You can
build a variety of VMs for local or cloud use, usually within a few minutes
or less.  Virt-builder also has many ways to customize these VMs.
Everything is run from the command line and nothing requires root
privileges, so automation and scripting is simple.
.PP
Note that virt-builder does not install guests from scratch.  It takes
cleanly prepared, digitally signed \s-1OS\s0 templates and customizes them.  This
approach is used because it is much faster, but if you need to do fresh
installs you may want to look at \fIvirt\-install\fR\|(1) and \fIoz\-install\fR\|(1).
.PP
The easiest way to get started is by looking at the examples in the next
section.

.SS "List the virtual machines available"
.IX Subsection "List the virtual machines available"
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder \-\-list
.Ve
.PP
will list out the operating systems available to install.  A selection of
freely redistributable OSes is available as standard.  You can add your own
too (see below).
.PP
After choosing a guest from the list, you may want to see if there are any
installation notes:
.PP

.SS "Build a virtual machine"
.IX Subsection "Build a virtual machine"
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20

.PP
will build a Fedora 20 image.  This will have all default configuration
(minimal size, no user accounts, random root password, only the bare minimum
installed software, etc.).
.PP
You \fIdo not\fR need to run this command as root.
.PP
The first time this runs it has to download the template over the network,
but this gets cached (see \*(L"\s-1CACHING\*(R"\s0).
.PP
The name of the output file is derived from the template name, so above it
will be \f(CW\*(C`fedora\-20.img\*(C'\fR.  You can change the output filename using the
\&\fI\-o\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-o mydisk.img
.Ve
.PP
You can also use the \fI\-o\fR option to write to existing devices or logical
volumes.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-\-format qcow2

.PP
As above, but write the output in qcow2 format to \f(CW\*(C`fedora\-20.qcow2\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
As above, but the output size will be 20 \s-1GB. \s0 The guest \s-1OS\s0 is resized as it
is copied to the output (automatically, using \fIvirt\-resize\fR\|(1)).
.SS "Setting the root password"
.IX Subsection "Setting the root password"
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-\-root\-password file:/tmp/rootpw
.Ve
.PP
Create a Fedora 20 image.  The root password is taken from the file
\&\f(CW\*(C`/tmp/rootpw\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Note if you \fIdon't\fR set \fI\-\-root\-password\fR then the guest is given a
\&\fIrandom\fR root password.
.PP
You can also create user accounts.  See \*(L"\s-1USERS AND PASSWORDS\*(R"\s0 below.
.SS "Set the hostname"

Set the hostname to \f(CW\*(C`virt.example.com\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Installing software"
.IX Subsection "Installing software"
To install packages from the ordinary (guest) software repository (eg. yum
or apt):
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-\-install "inkscape,@Xfce Desktop"
.Ve
.PP
(In Fedora, \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR is used to install groups of packages.  On Debian you would
install a meta-package instead.)
.SS "Customizing the installation"
.IX Subsection "Customizing the installation"
There are many options that let you customize the installation.  These
include: \fI\-\-run\fR/\fI\-\-run\-command\fR, which run a shell script or command
while the disk image is being generated and lets you add or edit files that
go into the disk image.  \fI\-\-firstboot\fR/\fI\-\-firstboot\-command\fR, which let
you add scripts/commands that are run the first time the guest boots.
\&\fI\-\-edit\fR to edit files.  \fI\-\-upload\fR to upload files.

During the customization phase, the given disk is attached to the libguestfs
appliance.  This is used to provide extra software repositories or other
data for customization.
.Sp
You probably want to ensure the volume(s) or filesystems in the attached
disks are labelled (or use an \s-1ISO\s0 volume name) so that you can mount them by
label in your run-scripts:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& mkdir /tmp/mount

Check that the index and templates are signed by the key with the given
fingerprint.  (The fingerprint is a long string, usually written as 10
groups of 4 hexadecimal digits).

The script is automatically chmod +x after installation in the guest.
.Sp
The alternative version \fI\-\-firstboot\-command\fR is the same, but it
conveniently wraps the command up in a single line script for you.

.IX Item "--get-kernel IMAGE"
This option extracts the kernel and initramfs from a previously built disk
image called \f(CW\*(C`IMAGE\*(C'\fR (in fact it works for any \s-1VM\s0 disk image, not just ones
built using virt-builder).
.Sp
The kernel and initramfs are written to the current directory, unless you
also specify the \fI\-\-output\fR \f(CW\*(C`outputdir\*(C'\fR \fBdirectory\fR name.
.Sp
The format of the disk image is automatically detected unless you specify it
by using the \fI\-\-format\fR option.
.Sp
In the case where the guest contains multiple kernels, the one with the
highest version number is chosen.  To extract arbitrary kernels from the
disk image, see \fIguestfish\fR\|(1).  To extract the entire \f(CW\*(C`/boot\*(C'\fR directory

also works if the directory already exists.
.IP "\fB\-\-network\fR" 4
.IX Item "--network"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-network\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-network"
.PD
Enable or disable network access from the guest during the installation.
.Sp
Enabled is the default.  Use \fI\-\-no\-network\fR to disable access.
.Sp
The network only allows outgoing connections and has other minor
limitations.  See \*(L"\s-1NETWORK\*(R"\s0 in \fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1).
.Sp
If you use \fI\-\-no\-network\fR then certain other options such as \fI\-\-install\fR
will not work.
.Sp
This does not affect whether the guest can access the network once it has
been booted, because that is controlled by your hypervisor or cloud
environment and has nothing to do with virt-builder.
.Sp
Generally speaking you should \fInot\fR use \fI\-\-no\-network\fR.  But here are some
reasons why you might want to:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Because the libguestfs backend that you are using doesn't support the
network.  (See: \*(L"\s-1BACKEND\*(R"\s0 in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3)).
.IP "2." 4
Any software you need to install comes from an attached \s-1ISO,\s0 so you don't
need the network.
.IP "3." 4
You don't want untrusted guest code trying to access your host network when
running virt-builder.  This is particularly an issue when you don't trust
the source of the operating system templates.  (See \*(L"\s-1SECURITY\*(R"\s0 below).
.IP "4." 4
You don't have a host network (eg. in secure/restricted environments).
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sync\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sync"
Do not sync the output file on exit.
.Sp
Virt-builder fsync's the output file or disk image when it exits.
.Sp
The reason is that qemu/KVM's default caching mode is \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`directsync\*(C'\fR, both of which bypass the host page cache.  Therefore these
would not work correctly if you immediately started the guest after running
virt-builder \- they would not see the complete output file.  (Note that you
should not use these caching modes \- they are fundamentally broken for this
and other reasons.)
.Sp
If you are not using these broken caching modes, you can use \fI\-\-no\-sync\fR to
avoid this unnecessary sync and gain considerable extra performance.
.IP "\fB\-\-notes\fR os-version" 4
.IX Item "--notes os-version"
List any notes associated with this guest, then exit (this does not do the
install).
.IP "\fB\-o\fR filename" 4
.IX Item "-o filename"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\fR filename" 4
.IX Item "--output filename"
.PD
Write the output to \f(CW\*(C`filename\*(C'\fR.  If you don't specify this option, then the
output filename is generated by taking the \f(CW\*(C`os\-version\*(C'\fR string and adding
\&\f(CW\*(C`.img\*(C'\fR (for raw format) or \f(CW\*(C`.qcow2\*(C'\fR (for qcow2 format).
.Sp
Note that the output filename could be a device, partition or logical
volume.

Run the shell script (or any program) called \f(CW\*(C`SCRIPT\*(C'\fR on the disk image.
The script runs virtualized inside a small appliance, chrooted into the

.Sp
The script is automatically chmod +x.
.Sp
If libguestfs supports it then a limited network connection is available but
it only allows outgoing network connections.  You can also attach data disks
(eg. \s-1ISO\s0 files) as another way to provide data (eg. software packages) to
the script without needing a network connection (\fI\-\-attach\fR).  You can also
upload data files (\fI\-\-upload\fR).
.Sp
The alternative version \fI\-\-run\-command\fR is the same, but it conveniently
wraps the command up in a single line script for you.

owner and permissions from the original are preserved, so you should set
them to what you want them to be in the disk image.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`DEST\*(C'\fR could be the final filename.  This can be used to rename the file on

.SS "\s-1INSTALLING PACKAGES\s0"
.IX Subsection "INSTALLING PACKAGES"
There are several approaches to installing packages or applications in the
guest which have different trade-offs.
.PP
\fIInstalling packages at build time\fR
.IX Subsection "Installing packages at build time"
.PP
If the guest \s-1OS\s0 you are installing is similar to the host \s-1OS \s0(eg.  both are
Linux), and if libguestfs supports network connections, then you can use
\&\fI\-\-install\fR to install packages like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-\-install inkscape
.Ve
.PP
This uses the guest's package manager and the host's network connection.
.PP
\fIUpdating packages at build time\fR
.IX Subsection "Updating packages at build time"
.PP
To update the core set of packages in the template at build time:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-\-update
.Ve
.PP
Most of the templates that ship with virt-builder come with a very minimal
selection of packages (known as a \*(L"\s-1JEOS\*(R"\s0 or \*(L"Just Enough Operating System\*(R"),
which are up to date at the time the template is created, but could be out
of date by the time you come to install an \s-1OS\s0 from the template.  This
option updates those template packages.
.PP
\fIInstalling packages at first boot\fR
.IX Subsection "Installing packages at first boot"
.PP
Another option is to install the packages when the guest first boots:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \-\-firstboot\-install inkscape
.Ve
.PP
This uses the guest's package manager and the guest's network connection.
.PP
The downsides are that it will take the guest a lot longer to boot first
time, and there's nothing much you can do if package installation fails
(eg. if a network problem means the guest can't reach the package
repositories).
.PP
\fIInstalling packages at build time from a side repository\fR
.IX Subsection "Installing packages at build time from a side repository"
.PP
If the software you want to install is not available in the main package
repository of the guest, then you can add a side repository.  Usually this
is presented as an \s-1ISO \s0(\s-1CD\s0 disk image) file containing extra packages.
.PP
You can create the disk image using either \fIgenisoimage\fR\|(1) or
\&\fIvirt\-make\-fs\fR\|(1).  For genisoimage, use a command like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& genisoimage \-o extra\-packages.iso \-R \-J \-V EXTRA cdcontents/
.Ve
.PP
Create a script that mounts the \s-1ISO\s0 and sets up the repository.  For yum,
create /tmp/install.sh containing:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& mkdir /tmp/mount
\& mount LABEL=EXTRA /tmp/mount
\& 
\& cat <<\*(AqEOF\*(Aq > /etc/yum.repos.d/extra.repo
\& [extra]
\& name=extra
\& baseurl=file:///tmp/mount
\& enabled=1
\& EOF
\& 
\& yum \-y install famousdatabase
.Ve
.PP
For apt, create /tmp/install.sh containing:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& mkdir /tmp/mount
\& mount LABEL=EXTRA /tmp/mount
\& 
\& apt\-cdrom \-d=/tmp/mount add
\& apt\-get \-y install famousdatabase
.Ve
.PP
Use the \fI\-\-attach\fR option to attach the \s-1CD /\s0 disk image and the \fI\-\-run\fR
option to run the script:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \e
\&   \-\-attach extra\-packages.iso \e
\&   \-\-run /tmp/install.sh
.Ve
.SS "\s-1USERS AND PASSWORDS\s0"
.IX Subsection "USERS AND PASSWORDS"
The \fI\-\-root\-password\fR option is used to change the root password (otherwise
a random password is used).  This option takes a password \f(CW\*(C`SELECTOR\*(C'\fR in one
of the following formats:
.IP "\fB\-\-root\-password\fR file:FILENAME" 4
.IX Item "--root-password file:FILENAME"
Read the root password from \f(CW\*(C`FILENAME\*(C'\fR.  The whole first line of this file
is the replacement password.  Any other lines are ignored.  You should
create the file with mode 0600 to ensure no one else can read it.
.IP "\fB\-\-root\-password\fR password:PASSWORD" 4
.IX Item "--root-password password:PASSWORD"
Set the root password to the literal string \f(CW\*(C`PASSWORD\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
\&\fBNote: this is not secure\fR since any user on the same machine can see the
cleartext password using \fIps\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fB\-\-root\-password\fR random" 4
.IX Item "--root-password random"
Choose a random password, which is printed on stdout.  The password has
approximately 120 bits of randomness.
.Sp
Типове значення.
.IP "\fB\-\-root\-password\fR disabled" 4
.IX Item "--root-password disabled"
The root account password is disabled.  This is like putting \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR in the
password field.

.PD
The root account is locked, but a password is placed on the account.  If

.PP
\fICreating user accounts\fR
.IX Subsection "Creating user accounts"
.PP
To create user accounts, use the \fIuseradd\fR\|(8) command with
\&\-\-firstboot\-command like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& virt\-builder \-\-firstboot\-command \e
\&    \*(Aquseradd \-m \-p "" rjones ; chage \-d 0 rjones\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
The above command will create an \f(CW\*(C`rjones\*(C'\fR account with no password, and
force the user to set a password when they first log in.  There are other
ways to manage passwords, see \fIuseradd\fR\|(8) for details.
.SS "\s-1KEYBOARD LAYOUT\s0"
.IX Subsection "KEYBOARD LAYOUT"
Because there are so many different ways to set the keyboard layout in Linux
distributions, virt-builder does not yet attempt to have a simple command
line option.  This section describes how to set the keyboard for some common
Linux distributions.
.PP
\fIKeyboard layout with systemd\fR
.IX Subsection "Keyboard layout with systemd"
.PP
For distros that use systemd \f(CW\*(C`localectl\*(C'\fR, use a command like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& virt\-builder fedora\-20 \e
\&   \-\-firstboot\-command \*(Aqlocalectl set\-keymap uk\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
See \fIlocalectl\fR\|(1) and
https://www.happyassassin.net/2013/11/23/keyboard\-layouts\-in\-fedora\-20\-and\-previously/
for more details.
.PP
\fIKeyboard layout using \f(CI\*(C`/etc/sysconfig/keyboard\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Keyboard layout using /etc/sysconfig/keyboard"
.PP
For \s-1RHEL\s0 ≤ 6, Fedora ≤ 18 and similar, upload or modify the keyboard
configuration file using the \fI\-\-upload\fR, \fI\-\-write\fR or \fI\-\-edit\fR options.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& virt\-builder centos\-6 \e
\&   \-\-edit \*(Aq/etc/sysconfig/keyboard: s/^KEYTABLE=.*/KEYTABLE="uk"/\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
The format of this file can be found documented in many places online.
.PP
\fIKeyboard layout with Debian-derived distros\fR
.IX Subsection "Keyboard layout with Debian-derived distros"
.PP
For Debian-derived distros using \f(CW\*(C`/etc/default/keyboard\*(C'\fR, upload or modify
the keyboard file using the \fI\-\-upload\fR, \fI\-\-write\fR or \fI\-\-edit\fR options.
For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& virt\-builder debian\-7 \e
\&   \-\-edit \*(Aq/etc/default/keyboard: s/^XKBLAYOUT=.*/XKBLAYOUT="gb"/\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
See https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard.
.SS "\s-1LANGUAGE\s0"
.IX Subsection "LANGUAGE"
Most Linux distributions support multiple locale settings so that you can
have guest messages printed in another language such as Russian.
.PP
However there is no single setting which controls this, since extra packages
may need to be installed to support console and X fonts, and keyboard input
methods.  The packages required, and their configuration is highly
distro-specific, and it is outside the scope of virt-builder to do this.
.PP
This section contains examples for some common Linux distributions.

.SS "\s-1CREATING YOUR OWN TEMPLATES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CREATING YOUR OWN TEMPLATES"
For serious virt-builder use, you may want to create your own repository of
templates.
.PP
\fILibguestfs.org repository\fR
.IX Subsection "Libguestfs.org repository"
.PP
Out of the box, virt-builder downloads the file
http://libguestfs.org/download/builder/index.asc which is an index of
available templates plus some information about each one, wrapped up in a
digital signature.  The command \f(CW\*(C`virt\-builder \-\-list\*(C'\fR lists out the
information in this index file.
.PP
The templates hosted on libguestfs.org were created using shell scripts,
kickstart files and preseed files which can be found in the libguestfs
source tree, in \f(CW\*(C`builder/website\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fISetting up the repository\fR
.IX Subsection "Setting up the repository"
.PP
You can set up your own site containing an index file and some templates,
and then point virt-builder at the site by using the \fI\-\-source\fR option:
.PP
.Vb 3

(Note setting the environment variables \f(CW\*(C`VIRT_BUILDER_SOURCE\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VIRT_BUILDER_FINGERPRINT\*(C'\fR may be easier to type!)
.PP
You can host this on any web or \s-1FTP\s0 server, or a local or network
filesystem.
.PP
\fISetting up a \s-1GPG\s0 key\fR
.IX Subsection "Setting up a GPG key"
.PP
If you don't have a GnuPG key, you will need to set one up.  (Strictly
speaking this is optional, but if your index and template files are not
signed then virt-builder users will have to use the \fI\-\-no\-check\-signature\fR
flag every time they use virt-builder.)
.PP
To create a key, see the \s-1GPG\s0 manual
http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html.
.PP
Export your \s-1GPG\s0 public key and add it to the keyring of all virt-builder
users:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& gpg \-\-export \-a "you@example.com" > pubkey
\& 
\& # For each virt\-builder user:

\fICreate the templates\fR
.IX Subsection "Create the templates"
.PP
There are many ways to create the templates.  For example you could clone
existing guests (see \fIvirt\-sysprep\fR\|(1)), or you could install a guest by
hand (\fIvirt\-install\fR\|(1)).  To see how the templates were created for
virt-builder, look at the scripts in \f(CW\*(C`builder/website\*(C'\fR
.PP
For best results when compressing the templates, use the following xz

.PP
The part in square brackets is the \f(CW\*(C`os\-version\*(C'\fR, which is the same string
that is used on the virt-builder command line to build that \s-1OS.\s0
.PP
After preparing the \f(CW\*(C`index\*(C'\fR file in the correct format, clearsign it using
the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& gpg \-\-clearsign \-\-armor index
.Ve
.PP
This will create the final file called \f(CW\*(C`index.asc\*(C'\fR which can be uploaded to
the server (and is the \fI\-\-source\fR \s-1URL\s0).  As noted above, signing the index
file is optional, but recommended.
.PP
The following fields can appear:
.ie n .IP """name=NAME""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWname=NAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "name=NAME"
The user-friendly name of this template.  This is displayed in the \fI\-\-list\fR
output but is otherwise not significant.
.ie n .IP """osinfo=ID""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWosinfo=ID\fR" 4
.IX Item "osinfo=ID"
This optional field maps the operating system to the associated libosinfo
\&\s-1ID. \s0 Virt-builder does not use it (yet).
.ie n .IP """file=PATH""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWfile=PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "file=PATH"
The path (relative to the index) of the xz-compressed template.
.Sp
Note that absolute paths or URIs are \fBnot\fR permitted here.  This is because
virt-builder has a \*(L"same origin\*(R" policy for templates so they cannot come
from other servers.
.ie n .IP """sig=PATH""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWsig=PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "sig=PATH"
\&\fBThis option is deprecated\fR.  Use the checksum field instead.
.Sp
The path (relative to the index) of the \s-1GPG\s0 detached signature of the xz
file.
.Sp
Note that absolute paths or URIs are \fBnot\fR permitted here.  This is because
virt-builder has a \*(L"same origin\*(R" policy for templates so they cannot come

.Sp
The file can be created as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& gpg \-\-detach\-sign \-\-armor \-o disk.xz.sig disk.xz
.Ve
.ie n .IP """checksum[sha512]=7b882fe9b82eb0fef...""" 4

.IX Item "checksum[sha512]=7b882fe9b82eb0fef..."
The \s-1SHA\-512\s0 checksum of the \fBcompressed\fR file is checked after it is
downloaded.  To work out the signature, do:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& sha512sum disk.xz
.Ve
.Sp
Note if you use this, you don't need to sign the file, ie. don't use
\&\f(CW\*(C`sig\*(C'\fR.  This option overrides \f(CW\*(C`sig\*(C'\fR.
.ie n .IP """checksum=7b882fe9b82eb0fef...""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWchecksum=7b882fe9b82eb0fef...\fR" 4
.IX Item "checksum=7b882fe9b82eb0fef..."
\&\f(CW\*(C`checksum\*(C'\fR is an alias for \f(CW\*(C`checksum[sha512]\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If you need to interoperate with virt-builder = 1.24.0 then you have to use
\&\f(CW\*(C`checksum\*(C'\fR because that version would give a parse error with square
brackets and numbers in the key of a field.  This is fixed in virt-builder
≥ 1.24.1.
.ie n .IP """revision=N""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWrevision=N\fR" 4
.IX Item "revision=N"
The revision is an integer which is used to control the template cache.
Increasing the revision number causes clients to download the template again
even if they have a copy in the cache.
.Sp
The revision number is optional.  If omitted it defaults to \f(CW1\fR.
.ie n .IP """format=raw""" 4

.PD 0
.ie n .IP """format=qcow2""" 4

.IX Item "format=qcow2"
.PD
Specify the format of the disk image (before it was compressed).  If not
given, the format is autodetected, but generally it is better to be explicit
about the intended format.
.Sp
Note this is the source format, which is different from the \fI\-\-format\fR
option (requested output format).  Virt-builder does on-the-fly conversion
from the source format to the requested output format.
.ie n .IP """size=NNN""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWsize=NNN\fR" 4
.IX Item "size=NNN"
The virtual size of the image in bytes.  This is the size of the image when
uncompressed.  If using a non-raw format such as qcow2 then it means the
virtual disk size, not the size of the qcow2 file.
.Sp
This field is required.
.Sp
Virt-builder also uses this as the minimum size that users can request via
the \fI\-\-size\fR option, or as the default size if there is no \fI\-\-size\fR
option.
.ie n .IP """compressed_size=NNN""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWcompressed_size=NNN\fR" 4
.IX Item "compressed_size=NNN"
The compressed size of the disk image in bytes.  This is just used for
information (when using \fI\-\-list \-\-long\fR).
.ie n .IP """expand=/dev/sdaX""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWexpand=/dev/sdaX\fR" 4
.IX Item "expand=/dev/sdaX"
When expanding the image to its final size, instruct \fIvirt\-resize\fR\|(1) to
expand the named partition in the guest image to fill up all available
space.  This works like the virt-resize \fI\-\-expand\fR option.
.Sp
You should usually put the device name of the guest's root filesystem here.
.Sp
It's a good idea to use this, but not required.  If the field is omitted
then virt-resize will create an extra partition at the end of the disk to
cover the free space, which is much less user-friendly.
.ie n .IP """lvexpand=/dev/VolGroup/LogVol""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWlvexpand=/dev/VolGroup/LogVol\fR" 4
.IX Item "lvexpand=/dev/VolGroup/LogVol"
When expanding the image to its final size, instruct \fIvirt\-resize\fR\|(1) to
expand the named logical volume in the guest image to fill up all available
space.  This works like the virt-resize \fI\-\-lv\-expand\fR option.
.Sp
If the guest uses \s-1LVM2\s0 you should usually put the \s-1LV\s0 of the guest's root
filesystem here.  If the guest does not use \s-1LVM2\s0 or its root filesystem is
not on an \s-1LV,\s0 don't use this option.
.ie n .IP """notes=NOTES""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWnotes=NOTES\fR" 4

Any notes that go with this image, especially notes describing what packages
are in the image, how the image was prepared, and licensing information.
.Sp
This information is shown in the \fI\-\-notes\fR and \fI\-\-list\fR \fI\-\-long\fR modes.
.Sp
You can use multi-line notes here by indenting each new line with at least
one character of whitespace (even on blank lines):

.SS "\s-1DIGITAL SIGNATURES\s0"
.IX Subsection "DIGITAL SIGNATURES"
Virt-builder uses \s-1GNU\s0 Privacy Guard (GnuPG or gpg) to verify that the index
and templates have not been tampered with.
.PP
The source points to an index file, which is optionally signed.
.PP
Virt-builder downloads the index and checks that the signature is valid and
the signer's fingerprint matches the specified fingerprint
(ie. \fI\-\-fingerprint\fR, \f(CW\*(C`VIRT_BUILDER_FINGERPRINT\*(C'\fR, or a built-in
fingerprint, in that order).
.PP
For checking against the built-in public key/fingerprint, this requires
importing the public key into the user's local gpg keyring (that's just the
way that gpg works).
.PP
When a template is downloaded, its signature is checked in the same way.
.PP
Although the signatures are optional, if you don't have them then
virt-builder users will have to use \fI\-\-no\-check\-signature\fR on the command
line.  This prevents an attacker from replacing the signed index file with
an unsigned index file and having virt-builder silently work without
checking the signature.  In any case it is highly recommended that you
always create signed index and templates.
.SS "АРХІТЕКТУРА"
.IX Subsection "АРХІТЕКТУРА"
Virt-builder can build a guest for any architecture no matter what the host
architecture is.  For example an x86\-64 guest on an \s-1ARM\s0 host.
.PP
However certain options may not work correctly, specifically options that
require running commands in the guest during the build process:
\&\fI\-\-install\fR, \fI\-\-update\fR, \fI\-\-run\fR, \fI\-\-run\-command\fR.  You may need to
replace these with their firstboot-equivalents.
.PP
An x86\-64 host building 32 bit i686 guests should work without any special
steps.
.SS "БЕЗПЕКА"
.IX Subsection "БЕЗПЕКА"
Virt-builder does not need to run as root (in fact, should not be run as
root), and doesn't use setuid, \f(CW\*(C`sudo\*(C'\fR or any similar mechanism.
.PP
\&\fI\-\-install\fR, \fI\-\-update\fR, \fI\-\-run\fR and \fI\-\-run\-command\fR are implemented
using an appliance (a small virtual machine) so these commands do not run on
the host.  If you are using the libguestfs libvirt backend and have SELinux
enabled then the virtual machine is additionally encapsulated in an SELinux
container (sVirt).
.PP
However these options will have access to the host's network and since the
template may contain untrusted code, the code might try to access host
network resources which it should not.  You can use \fI\-\-no\-network\fR to
prevent this.
.PP
Firstboot commands run in the context of the guest when it is booted, and so
the security of your hypervisor / cloud should be considered.
.PP
Virt-builder injects a random seed into every guest which it builds.  This
helps to ensure that \s-1TCP\s0 sequence numbers, UUIDs, ssh host keys etc are
truly random when the guest boots.
.PP
You should check digital signatures and not ignore any signing errors.
.SS "\s-1CLONES\s0"
.IX Subsection "CLONES"
If you wish to create many new guests of the same type, it is tempting to
run virt-builder once and then copy the output file.  You should \fBnot\fR do
this.  You should run virt-builder once for each new guest you need.
.PP
The reason is that each clone needs to have (at least) a separate random
seed, and possibly other unique features (such as filesystem UUIDs) in
future versions of virt-builder.
.PP
Another thing you should \fInot\fR do is to boot the guest, then clone the
booted disk image.  The reason is that some guests create unique machine
IDs, \s-1SSH\s0 host keys and so on at first boot, and you would not want clones to
have duplicate identities.
.PP
See also: \fIvirt\-sysprep\fR\|(1).
.SS "\s-1PERFORMANCE\s0"

information.
.PP
Packages required for the \fI\-\-install\fR and \fI\-\-update\fR options are

Since virt-builder does not know how to give new files a correct label, the
guest templates have an empty file \f(CW\*(C`/.autorelabel\*(C'\fR and this causes the
guest to relabel itself at first boot.
.PP
This usually means that these guests will reboot themselves once the first
time you use them.  \fBThis is normal, and harmless.\fR However if you want to
perform the relabelling at build time instead of delaying it to the first
boot, you can boot the guest with the qemu \fI\-no\-reboot\fR option (which means
it will shut down after the relabel is complete without booting \*(L"for
real\*(R").  Only do this if you are sure it is an SELinux guest:
