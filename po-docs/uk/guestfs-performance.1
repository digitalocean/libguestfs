guestfs-performance \- engineering libguestfs for greatest performance
.SH "ОПИС"
.IX Header "ОПИС"
This page documents how to get the greatest performance out of libguestfs,
especially when you expect to use libguestfs to manipulate thousands of
virtual machines or disk images.
.PP
Three main areas are covered. Libguestfs runs an appliance (a small Linux
distribution) inside qemu/KVM.  The first two areas are: minimizing the time
taken to start this appliance, and the number of times the appliance has to
be started.  The third area is shortening the time taken for inspection of
VMs.
.SH "BASELINE MEASUREMENTS"
.IX Header "BASELINE MEASUREMENTS"
Before making changes to how you use libguestfs, take baseline measurements.
.SS "Baseline: Starting the appliance"
.IX Subsection "Baseline: Starting the appliance"
On an unloaded machine, time how long it takes to start up the appliance:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& time guestfish \-a /dev/null run
.Ve
.PP
Run this command several times in a row and discard the first few runs, so
that you are measuring a typical \*(L"hot cache\*(R" case.
.PP
\&\fISide note for developers:\fR If you are compiling libguestfs from source,
there is a program called \fIutils/boot\-benchmark/boot\-benchmark\fR which does
the same thing, but performs multiple runs and prints the mean and standard
deviation.  To run it, do:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& make
\& ./run utils/boot\-benchmark/boot\-benchmark
.Ve
.PP
There is a manual page \fIutils/boot\-benchmark/boot\-benchmark.1\fR
.PP
\fIПояснення\fR
.IX Subsection "Пояснення"
.PP
The guestfish command above starts up the libguestfs appliance on a null
disk, and then immediately shuts it down.  The first time you run the
command, it will create an appliance and cache it (usually under
\&\fI/var/tmp/.guestfs\-*\fR).  Subsequent runs should reuse the cached appliance.
.PP
\fIОчікувані результати\fR
.IX Subsection "Очікувані результати"
.PP
You should expect to be getting times under 6 seconds.  If the times you see
on an unloaded machine are above this, then see the section
\&\*(L"\s-1TROUBLESHOOTING POOR PERFORMANCE\*(R"\s0 below.
.SS "Baseline: Performing inspection of a guest"
.IX Subsection "Baseline: Performing inspection of a guest"
For this test you will need an unloaded machine and at least one real guest
or disk image.  If you are planning to use libguestfs against only X guests
(eg. X = Windows), then using an X guest here would be most appropriate.  If
you are planning to run libguestfs against a mix of guests, then use a mix
of guests for testing here.
.PP
Time how long it takes to perform inspection and mount the disks of the
guest.  Use the first command if you will be using disk images, and the
second command if you will be using libvirt.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& time guestfish \-\-ro \-a диск.img \-i exit
\&
\& time guestfish \-\-ro \-d GuestName \-i exit
.Ve
.PP
Run the command several times in a row and discard the first few runs, so
that you are measuring a typical \*(L"hot cache\*(R" case.
.PP
\fIПояснення\fR
.IX Subsection "Пояснення"
.PP
This command starts up the libguestfs appliance on the named disk image or
libvirt guest, performs libguestfs inspection on it (see
\&\*(L"\s-1INSPECTION\*(R"\s0 in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3)), mounts the guest's disks, then discards all these
results and shuts down.
.PP
The first time you run the command, it will create an appliance and cache it
(usually under \fI/var/tmp/.guestfs\-*\fR).  Subsequent runs should reuse the
cached appliance.
.PP
\fIОчікувані результати\fR
.IX Subsection "Очікувані результати"
.PP
You should expect times which are ≤ 5 seconds greater than measured in
the first baseline test above.  (For example, if the first baseline test ran
in 5 seconds, then this test should run in ≤ 10 seconds).
.SH "UNDERSTANDING THE APPLIANCE AND WHEN IT IS BUILT/CACHED"
.IX Header "UNDERSTANDING THE APPLIANCE AND WHEN IT IS BUILT/CACHED"
The first time you use libguestfs, it will build and cache an appliance.
This is usually in \fI/var/tmp/.guestfs\-*\fR, unless you have set \f(CW$TMPDIR\fR or
\&\f(CW$LIBGUESTFS_CACHEDIR\fR in which case it will be under that temporary
directory.
.PP
For more information about how the appliance is constructed, see
\&\*(L"\s-1SUPERMIN APPLIANCES\*(R"\s0 in \fIsupermin\fR\|(1).
.PP
Every time libguestfs runs it will check that no host files used by the
appliance have changed.  If any have, then the appliance is rebuilt.  This
usually happens when a package is installed or updated on the host
(eg. using programs like \f(CW\*(C`yum\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`apt\-get\*(C'\fR).  The reason for
reconstructing the appliance is security: the new program that has been
installed might contain a security fix, and so we want to include the fixed
program in the appliance automatically.
.PP
These are the performance implications:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The process of building (or rebuilding) the cached appliance is slow, and
you can avoid this happening by using a fixed appliance (see below).
.IP "\(bu" 4
If not using a fixed appliance, be aware that updating software on the host
will cause a one time rebuild of the appliance.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fI/var/tmp\fR (or \f(CW$TMPDIR\fR, \f(CW$LIBGUESTFS_CACHEDIR\fR) should be on a fast
disk, and have plenty of space for the appliance.
.SH "USING A FIXED APPLIANCE"
.IX Header "USING A FIXED APPLIANCE"
To fully control when the appliance is built, you can build a fixed
appliance.  This appliance should be stored on a fast local disk.
.PP
Щоб зібрати образ системи для розгортання, віддайте таку команду:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& libguestfs\-make\-fixed\-appliance <каталог>
.Ve
.PP
replacing \f(CW\*(C`<directory>\*(C'\fR with the name of a directory where the
appliance will be stored (normally you would name a subdirectory, for
example: \fI/usr/local/lib/guestfs/appliance\fR or \fI/dev/shm/appliance\fR).
.PP
Then set \f(CW$LIBGUESTFS_PATH\fR (and ensure this environment variable is set in
your libguestfs program), or modify your program so it calls
\&\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_set_path\*(C'\fR.  For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& export LIBGUESTFS_PATH=/usr/local/lib/guestfs/appliance
.Ve
.PP
Now you can run libguestfs programs, virt tools, guestfish etc. as normal.
The programs will use your fixed appliance, and will not ever build,
rebuild, or cache their own appliance.
.PP
(For detailed information on this subject, see:
\&\fIlibguestfs\-make\-fixed\-appliance\fR\|(1)).
.SS "Performance of the fixed appliance"
.IX Subsection "Performance of the fixed appliance"
In our testing we did not find that using a fixed appliance gave any
measurable performance benefit, even when the appliance was located in
memory (ie. on \fI/dev/shm\fR).  However there are two points to consider:
.IP "1." 4
Using a fixed appliance stops libguestfs from ever rebuilding the appliance,
meaning that libguestfs will have more predictable start-up times.
.IP "2." 4
The appliance is loaded on demand.  A simple test such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& time guestfish \-a /dev/null run
.Ve
.Sp
does not load very much of the appliance.  A real libguestfs program using
complicated \s-1API\s0 calls would demand-load a lot more of the appliance.  Being
able to store the appliance in a specified location makes the performance
more predictable.
.SH "REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE APPLIANCE IS LAUNCHED"
.IX Header "REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE APPLIANCE IS LAUNCHED"
By far the most effective, though not always the simplest way to get good
performance is to ensure that the appliance is launched the minimum number
of times.  This will probably involve changing your libguestfs application.
.PP
Try to call \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_launch\*(C'\fR at most once per target virtual machine or
disk image.
.PP
Instead of using a separate instance of \fIguestfish\fR\|(1) to make a series of
changes to the same guest, use a single instance of guestfish and/or use the
guestfish \fI\-\-listen\fR option.
.PP
Consider writing your program as a daemon which holds a guest open while
making a series of changes.  Or marshal all the operations you want to
perform before opening the guest.
.PP
You can also try adding disks from multiple guests to a single appliance.
Before trying this, note the following points:
.IP "1." 4
Adding multiple guests to one appliance is a security problem because it may
allow one guest to interfere with the disks of another guest.  Only do it if
you trust all the guests, or if you can group guests by trust.
.IP "2." 4
There is a hard limit to the number of disks you can add to a single
appliance.  Call \*(L"guestfs_max_disks\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) to get this limit.  For
further information see \*(L"\s-1LIMITS\*(R"\s0 in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3).
.IP "3." 4
Using libguestfs this way is complicated.  Disks can have unexpected
interactions: for example, if two guests use the same \s-1UUID\s0 for a filesystem
(because they were cloned), or have volume groups with the same name (but
see \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_lvm_set_filter\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\fIvirt\-df\fR\|(1) adds multiple disks by default, so the source code for this
program would be a good place to start.
.SH "SHORTENING THE TIME TAKEN FOR INSPECTION OF VMs"
.IX Header "SHORTENING THE TIME TAKEN FOR INSPECTION OF VMs"
The main advice is obvious: Do not perform inspection (which is expensive)
unless you need the results.
.PP
If you previously performed inspection on the guest, then it may be safe to
cache and reuse the results from last time.
.PP
Some disks don't need to be inspected at all: for example, if you are
creating a disk image, or if the disk image is not a \s-1VM,\s0 or if the disk
image has a known layout.
.PP
Even when basic inspection (\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_inspect_os\*(C'\fR) is required, auxiliary
inspection operations may be avoided:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Mounting disks is only necessary to get further filesystem information.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Listing applications (\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_inspect_list_applications\*(C'\fR) is an expensive
operation on Linux, but almost free on Windows.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Generating a guest icon (\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_inspect_get_icon\*(C'\fR) is cheap on Linux but
expensive on Windows.
.SH "PARALLEL APPLIANCES"
.IX Header "PARALLEL APPLIANCES"
Libguestfs appliances are mostly I/O bound and you can launch multiple
appliances in parallel.  Provided there is enough free memory, there should
be little difference in launching 1 appliance vs N appliances in parallel.
.PP
On a 2\-core (4\-thread) laptop with 16 \s-1GB\s0 of \s-1RAM,\s0 using the (not especially
realistic) test Perl script below, the following plot shows excellent
scalability when running between 1 and 20 appliances in parallel:

However \s-1UML\s0 often performs the same under virtualization as it does on

hardware virt acceleration is not available).

Upload and download is as much as 10 times slower on \s-1UML\s0 than \s-1KVM.\s0
Libguestfs sends this data over the \s-1UML\s0 emulated serial port, which is far
less efficient than \s-1KVM\s0's virtio-serial.

.SS "Detailed timings using SystemTap"
.IX Subsection "Detailed timings using SystemTap"
You can use SystemTap (\fIstap\fR\|(1)) to get detailed timings from libguestfs
programs.
.PP
Save the following script as \fItime.stap\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& global last;
\& 
\& function display_time () {
\&       now = gettimeofday_us ();
\&       delta = 0;
\&       if (last > 0)
\&             delta = now \- last;
\&       last = now;
\& 
\&       printf ("%d (+%d):", now, delta);
\& }
\& 
\& probe begin {
\&       last = 0;
\&       printf ("ready\en");
\& }
\& 
\& /* Display all calls to static markers. */
\& probe process("/usr/lib*/libguestfs.so.0")
\&           .provider("guestfs").mark("*") ? {
\&       display_time();
\&       printf ("\et%s %s\en", $$name, $$parms);
\& }
\& 
\& /* Показати усі виклики функцій guestfs_*. */
\& probe process("/usr/lib*/libguestfs.so.0")
\&           .function("guestfs_[a\-z]*") ? {
\&       display_time();
\&       printf ("\et%s %s\en", probefunc(), $$parms);
\& }
.Ve
.PP
Run it as root in one window:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& # stap time.stap
\& ready
.Ve
.PP
It prints \*(L"ready\*(R" when SystemTap has loaded the program.  Run your
libguestfs program, guestfish or a virt tool in another window.  For
example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ guestfish \-a /dev/null run
.Ve
.PP
In the stap window you will see a large amount of output, with the time
taken for each step shown (microseconds in parenthesis).  For example:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& xxxx (+0):     guestfs_create 
\& xxxx (+29):    guestfs_set_pgroup g=0x17a9de0 pgroup=0x1
\& xxxx (+9):     guestfs_add_drive_opts_argv g=0x17a9de0 [...]
\& xxxx (+8):     guestfs_int_safe_strdup g=0x17a9de0 str=0x7f8a153bed5d
\& xxxx (+19):    guestfs_int_safe_malloc g=0x17a9de0 nbytes=0x38
\& xxxx (+5):     guestfs_int_safe_strdup g=0x17a9de0 str=0x17a9f60
\& xxxx (+10):    guestfs_launch g=0x17a9de0
\& xxxx (+4):     launch_start 
\& [etc]
.Ve
.PP
You will need to consult, and even modify, the source to libguestfs to fully
understand the output.
.SS "Detailed debugging using gdb"
.IX Subsection "Detailed debugging using gdb"
You can attach to the appliance BIOS/kernel using gdb.  If you know what
you're doing, this can be a useful way to diagnose boot regressions.
.PP
Firstly, you have to change qemu so it runs with the \f(CW\*(C`\-S\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR
options.  These options cause qemu to pause at boot and allow you to attach
a debugger.  Read \fIqemu\fR\|(1) for further information.  Libguestfs invokes
qemu several times (to scan the help output and so on) and you only want the
final invocation of qemu to use these options, so use a qemu wrapper script
like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& #!/bin/bash \-
\& 
\& # Set this to point to the real qemu binary.
\& qemu=/usr/bin/qemu\-kvm
\& 
\& if [ "$1" != "\-global" ]; then
\&     # Scanning help output etc.
\&     exec $qemu "$@"
\& else 
\&     # Really running qemu.
\&     exec $qemu \-S \-s "$@"
\& fi
.Ve
.PP
Now run guestfish or another libguestfs tool with the qemu wrapper (see
\&\*(L"\s-1QEMU WRAPPERS\*(R"\s0 in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) to understand what this is doing):
.PP
.Vb 1
\& LIBGUESTFS_HV=/path/to/qemu\-wrapper guestfish \-a /dev/null \-v run
.Ve
.PP
This should pause just after qemu launches.  In another window, attach to
qemu using gdb:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& $ gdb
\& (gdb) set architecture i8086
\& The target architecture is assumed to be i8086
\& (gdb) target remote :1234
\& Remote debugging using :1234
\& 0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
\& (gdb) cont
.Ve
.PP
At this point you can use standard gdb techniques, eg. hitting \f(CW\*(C`^C\*(C'\fR to
interrupt the boot and \f(CW\*(C`bt\*(C'\fR get a stack trace, setting breakpoints, etc.
Note that when you are past the \s-1BIOS\s0 and into the Linux kernel, you'll want
to change the architecture back to 32 or 64 bit.
.SH "PERFORMANCE REGRESSIONS IN OTHER PROGRAMS"
.IX Header "PERFORMANCE REGRESSIONS IN OTHER PROGRAMS"
Sometimes performance regressions happen in other programs (eg. qemu, the
kernel) that cause problems for libguestfs.
.PP
In the libguestfs source, \fIutils/boot\-benchmark/boot\-benchmark\-range.pl\fR is
a script which can be used to benchmark libguestfs across a range of git
commits in another project to find out if any commit is causing a slowdown
(or speedup).
.PP
To find out how to use this script, consult the manual:
.PP
.Vb 1
