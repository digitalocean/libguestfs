libguestfs is a way to create, access and modify disk images.  You can look
inside disk images, modify the files they contain, create them from scratch,
resize them, and much more.  It's especially useful from scripts and
programs and from the command line.
.PP
libguestfs is a C library (hence \*(L"lib\-\*(R"), and a set of tools built on this
library, and bindings for many common programming languages.
.PP
For more information about what libguestfs can do read the introduction on
the home page (http://libguestfs.org).
.SS "Для чого призначено virt tools?"
.IX Subsection "Для чого призначено virt tools?"
Virt tools (website: http://virt\-tools.org) are a whole set of
virtualization management tools aimed at system administrators.  Some of
them come from libguestfs, some from libvirt and many others from other open
source projects.  So virt tools is a superset of libguestfs.  However
libguestfs comes with many important tools.  See http://libguestfs.org
for a full list.

.PP
libguestfs works with any disk image, including ones created in VMware, \s-1KVM\s0,
qemu, VirtualBox, Xen, and many other hypervisors, and ones which you have
created from scratch.
.PP
Red Hat sponsors (ie. pays for) development of libguestfs and a huge
number of other open source projects.  But you can run libguestfs and the
virt tools on many different Linux distros and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  We try our best to
support all Linux distros as first-class citizens.  Some virt tools have
been ported to Windows.

.IP "\fIпорівняно з kpartx\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з kpartx"
Libguestfs takes a different approach from kpartx.  kpartx needs root, and
mounts filesystems on the host kernel (which can be insecure \- see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY\s0\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3)).  Libguestfs isolates your host kernel from guests,
is more flexible, scriptable, supports \s-1LVM\s0, doesn't require root, is
isolated from other processes, and cleans up after itself.  Libguestfs is
more than just file access because you can use it to create images from
scratch.
.IP "\fIпорівняно з vdfuse\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з vdfuse"
vdfuse is like kpartx but for VirtualBox images.  See the kpartx comparison
above.  You can use libguestfs on the partition files exposed by vdfuse,
although it's not necessary since libguestfs can access VirtualBox images
directly.

Типові симптоми проблеми:
.IP "\(bu" 4
You get an error when you create a file where the filename contains
non-ASCII characters, particularly non 8\-bit characters from Asian languages
(Chinese, Japanese, etc).  The filesystem is \s-1VFAT\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When you list a directory from a \s-1VFAT\s0 filesystem, filenames appear as
question marks.
.PP
This is a design flaw of the GNU/Linux system.
.PP
\&\s-1VFAT\s0 stores long filenames as \s-1UTF\-16\s0 characters.  When opening or returning
filenames, the Linux kernel has to translate these to some form of 8 bit
string.  \s-1UTF\-8\s0 would be the obvious choice, except for Linux users who
persist in using non\-UTF\-8 locales (the user's locale is not known to the
kernel because it's a function of libc).
.PP
Therefore you have to tell the kernel what translation you want done when
you mount the filesystem.  The two methods are the \f(CW\*(C`iocharset\*(C'\fR parameter
(which is not relevant to libguestfs) and the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag.
.PP
So to use a \s-1VFAT\s0 filesystem you must add the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag when mounting.
From guestfish, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ><fs> параметри_монтування utf8 /dev/sda1 /
.Ve
.PP
or on the guestfish command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& guestfish [...] \-m /dev/sda1:/:utf8
.Ve
.PP
або з програмного інтерфейсу:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& guestfs_mount_options (g, "utf8", "/dev/sda1", "/");
.Ve
.PP
The kernel will then translate filenames to and from \s-1UTF\-8\s0 strings.
.PP
We considered adding this mount option transparently, but unfortunately
there are several problems with doing that:
.IP "\(bu" 4
On some Linux systems, the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR mount option doesn't work.  We don't
precisely understand what systems or why, but this was reliably reported by
one user.
.IP "\(bu" 4
It would prevent you from using the \f(CW\*(C`iocharset\*(C'\fR parameter because it is
incompatible with \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR.  It is probably not a good idea to use this
parameter, but we don't want to prevent it.
.SS "Non-ASCII characters appear as underscore (_) on \s-1ISO9660\s0 filesystems."
.IX Subsection "Non-ASCII characters appear as underscore (_) on ISO9660 filesystems."
The filesystem was not prepared correctly with mkisofs or genisoimage.  Make
sure the filesystem was created using Joliet and/or Rock Ridge extensions.
libguestfs does not require any special mount options to handle the
filesystem.

Because of the complexity of building the libguestfs appliance, the source

If you don't have or want to use Koji, then you have to give libguestfs
access to the network so it can download the RPMs for building the

.PP
SVirt provides a hardened appliance
using SELinux, making it very hard for a rogue disk image to \*(L"escape\*(R" from
the confinement of libguestfs and damage the host (it's fair to say that
even in standard libguestfs this would be hard, but sVirt provides an extra
layer of protection for the host and more importantly protects virtual
machines on the same host from each other).
.PP
Currently to enable sVirt you will need libvirt ≥ 0.10.2 (1.0 or later
preferred), libguestfs ≥ 1.20, and the SELinux policies from recent
Fedora.  If you are not running Fedora 18+, you will need to make changes
to your SELinux policy \- contact us on the mailing list.
.PP
Once you have the requirements, do:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& ./configure \-\-with\-default\-backend=libvirt       # libguestfs >= 1.22
\& ./configure \-\-with\-default\-attach\-method=libvirt # libguestfs <= 1.20
\& make
.Ve
.PP
Set SELinux to Enforcing mode, and sVirt should be used automatically.
.PP
All, or almost all, features of libguestfs should work under sVirt.  There
is one known shortcoming: \fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1) will not use libvirt (hence
sVirt), but falls back to direct launch of qemu.  So you won't currently get
the benefit of sVirt protection when using virt-rescue.
.PP
You can check if sVirt is being used by enabling libvirtd logging (see
\&\f(CW\*(C`/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.log\*(C'\fR), killing and restarting libvirtd, and checking
the log files for \*(L"Setting SELinux context on ...\*(R" messages.
.PP
In theory sVirt should support AppArmor, but we have not tried it.  It will
almost certainly require patching libvirt and writing an AppArmor policy.

If the underlying disk is not fully allocated (eg. sparse raw or qcow2) then
writes can be slow because the host operating system has to do costly disk

Resizing a disk image is very tricky \*(-- especially making sure that you
don't lose data or break the bootloader.  The current method effectively
creates a new disk image and copies the data plus bootloader from the old
one.  If something goes wrong, you can always go back to the original.
.PP
If we were to make virt-resize work in-place then there would have to be
limitations: for example, you wouldn't be allowed to move existing
partitions (because moving data across the same disk is most likely to
corrupt data in the event of a power failure or crash), and \s-1LVM\s0 would be
very difficult to support (because of the almost arbitrary mapping between
\&\s-1LV\s0 content and underlying disk blocks).
.PP
Another method we have considered is to place a snapshot over the original
disk image, so that the original data is untouched and only differences are
recorded in the snapshot.  You can do this today using \f(CW\*(C`qemu\-img create\*(C'\fR +
\&\f(CW\*(C`virt\-resize\*(C'\fR, but qemu currently isn't smart enough to recognize when the
same block is written back to the snapshot as already exists in the backing
disk, so you will find that this doesn't save you any space or time.
.PP
In summary, this is a hard problem, and what we have now mostly works so we
are reluctant to change it.
.SS "Why doesn't virt-sparsify work on the disk image in-place?"
.IX Subsection "Why doesn't virt-sparsify work on the disk image in-place?"
Eventually we plan to make virt-sparsify work on disk images in-place,
instead of copying the disk image.  However it requires several changes to
both the Linux kernel and qemu which are slowly making their way upstream
(thanks to the tireless efforts of Paolo Bonzini).  Then we will have to
modify virt-sparsify to support this.  Finally there will be some
integration work required to make sure all the pieces work together.
.PP
Even with this implemented there may be some limitations: For example, it
requires completely different steps (and is probably harder) to sparsify a
disk image that is stored on a \s-1SAN\s0 \s-1LUN\s0, compared to one which is stored in a
local raw image file, so you can expect that different storage and backing
formats will become supported at different times.  Some backing filesystems
/ formats may never support sparsification (eg. disk images stored on \s-1VFAT\s0,
old-style non-thin LVs).

.SS "Why don't you do everything through the \s-1FUSE\s0 / filesystem interface?"
.IX Subsection "Why don't you do everything through the FUSE / filesystem interface?"
We offer a command called \fIguestmount\fR\|(1) which lets you mount guest
filesystems on the host.  This is implemented as a \s-1FUSE\s0 module.  Why don't
we just implement the whole of libguestfs using this mechanism, instead of
having the large and rather complicated \s-1API\s0?
.PP
The reasons are twofold.  Firstly, libguestfs offers \s-1API\s0 calls for doing
things like creating and deleting partitions and logical volumes, which
don't fit into a filesystem model very easily.  Or rather, you could fit
them in: for example, creating a partition could be mapped to \f(CW\*(C`mkdir
/fs/hda1\*(C'\fR but then you'd have to specify some method to choose the size of
the partition (maybe \f(CW\*(C`echo 100M > /fs/hda1/.size\*(C'\fR), and the partition
type, start and end sectors etc., but once you've done that the
filesystem-based \s-1API\s0 starts to look more complicated than the call-based \s-1API\s0
we currently have.
.PP
The second reason is for efficiency.  \s-1FUSE\s0 itself is reasonably efficient,
but it does make lots of small, independent calls into the \s-1FUSE\s0 module.  In
guestmount these have to be translated into messages to the libguestfs
appliance which has a big overhead (in time and round trips).  For example,
reading a file in 64 \s-1KB\s0 chunks is inefficient because each chunk would turn
into a single round trip.  In the libguestfs \s-1API\s0 it is much more efficient
to download an entire file or directory through one of the streaming calls
like \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_download\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_tar_out\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Why don't you do everything through \s-1GVFS\s0?"
.IX Subsection "Why don't you do everything through GVFS?"
The problems are similar to the problems with \s-1FUSE\s0.
.PP
\&\s-1GVFS\s0 is a better abstraction than \s-1POSIX/FUSE\s0.  There is an \s-1FTP\s0 backend for
\&\s-1GVFS\s0, which is encouraging because \s-1FTP\s0 is conceptually similar to the
libguestfs \s-1API\s0.  However the \s-1GVFS\s0 \s-1FTP\s0 backend makes multiple simultaneous
connections in order to keep interactivity, which we can't easily do with
libguestfs.
.SS "Why can I write to the disk, even though I added it read-only?"

.ie n .SS "Why does ""\-\-ro"" appear to have no effect?"
.el .SS "Why does \f(CW\-\-ro\fP appear to have no effect?"
.IX Subsection "Why does --ro appear to have no effect?"
When you add a disk read-only, libguestfs places a writable overlay on top
of the underlying disk.  Writes go into this overlay, and are discarded when
the handle is closed (or \f(CW\*(C`guestfish\*(C'\fR etc. exits).
.PP
There are two reasons for doing it this way: Firstly read-only disks aren't
possible in many cases (eg. \s-1IDE\s0 simply doesn't support them, so you couldn't
have an IDE-emulated read-only disk, although this is not common in real
libguestfs installations).
.PP
Secondly and more importantly, even if read-only disks were possible, you
wouldn't want them.  Mounting any filesystem that has a journal, even
\&\f(CW\*(C`mount \-o ro\*(C'\fR, causes writes to the filesystem because the journal has to
be replayed and metadata updated.  If the disk was truly read-only, you
wouldn't be able to mount a dirty filesystem.
.PP
To make it usable, we create the overlay as a place to temporarily store
these writes, and then we discard it afterwards.  This ensures that the
underlying disk is always untouched.
.PP
Note also that there is a regression test for this when building libguestfs
(in \f(CW\*(C`tests/qemu\*(C'\fR).  This is one reason why it's important for packagers to
run the test suite.
.ie n .SS "Does ""\-\-ro"" make all disks read-only?"
.el .SS "Does \f(CW\-\-ro\fP make all disks read-only?"
.IX Subsection "Does --ro make all disks read-only?"
\&\fINo!\fR The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-ro\*(C'\fR option only affects disks added on the command line,
ie. using \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR options.
.PP
In guestfish, if you use the \f(CW\*(C`add\*(C'\fR command, then disk is added read-write
(unless you specify the \f(CW\*(C`readonly:true\*(C'\fR flag explicitly with the command).
.ie n .SS "Can I use ""guestfish \-\-ro"" as a way to backup my virtual machines?"
.el .SS "Can I use \f(CWguestfish \-\-ro\fP as a way to backup my virtual machines?"

Usually this is \fInot\fR a good idea.  The question is answered in more detail
in this mailing list posting:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010\-August/msg00024.html
.PP
See also the next question.
.ie n .SS "Why can't I run fsck on a live filesystem using ""guestfish \-\-ro""?"
.el .SS "Why can't I run fsck on a live filesystem using \f(CWguestfish \-\-ro\fP?"

This command will usually \fInot\fR work:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& guestfish \-\-ro \-a /dev/vg/my_root_fs run : fsck /dev/sda
.Ve
.PP
The reason for this is that qemu creates a snapshot over the original
filesystem, but it doesn't create a strict point-in-time snapshot.  Blocks
of data on the underlying filesystem are read by qemu at different times as
the fsck operation progresses, with host writes in between.  The result is
that fsck sees massive corruption (imaginary, not real!) and fails.
.PP
What you have to do is to create a point-in-time snapshot.  If it's a
logical volume, use an \s-1LVM2\s0 snapshot.  If the filesystem is located inside
something like a btrfs/ZFS file, use a btrfs/ZFS snapshot, and then run the
fsck on the snapshot.  In practice you don't need to use libguestfs for this
\&\*(-- just run \f(CW\*(C`/sbin/fsck\*(C'\fR directly.
.PP
Creating point-in-time snapshots of host devices and files is outside the
scope of libguestfs, although libguestfs can operate on them once they are
created.
.SS "What's the difference between guestfish and virt-rescue?"
.IX Subsection "What's the difference between guestfish and virt-rescue?"
A lot of people are confused by the two superficially similar tools we
provide:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& $ guestfish \-\-ro \-a guest.img
\& ><fs> run
\& ><fs> fsck /dev/sda1
\&
\& $ virt\-rescue \-\-ro guest.img
\& ><rescue> /sbin/fsck /dev/sda1
.Ve
.PP
And the related question which then arises is why you can't type in full
shell commands with all the \-\-options in guestfish (but you can in
\&\fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1)).
.PP
\&\fIguestfish\fR\|(1) is a program providing structured access to the
\&\fIguestfs\fR\|(3) \s-1API\s0.  It happens to be a nice interactive shell too, but its
primary purpose is structured access from shell scripts.  Think of it more
like a language binding, like Python and other bindings, but for shell.  The
key differentiating factor of guestfish (and the libguestfs \s-1API\s0 in general)
is the ability to automate changes.
.PP
\&\fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1) is a free-for-all freeform way to boot the libguestfs
appliance and make arbitrary changes to your \s-1VM\s0. It's not structured, you
can't automate it, but for making quick ad-hoc fixes to your guests, it can
be quite useful.
.PP
But, libguestfs also has a \*(L"backdoor\*(R" into the appliance allowing you to
send arbitrary shell commands.  It's not as flexible as virt-rescue, because
you can't interact with the shell commands, but here it is anyway:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ><fs> debug sh "cmd arg1 arg2 ..."
.Ve
.PP
Note that you should \fBnot\fR rely on this.  It could be removed or changed in
future. If your program needs some operation, please add it to the
libguestfs \s-1API\s0 instead.

.PP
At the \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) \s-1API\s0 level, a \*(L"disk image\*(R" is just a pile of partitions
and filesystems.
.PP
In contrast, when the virtual machine boots, it mounts those filesystems
into a consistent hierarchy such as:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& /          (/dev/sda2)

\& +\-\- /boot  (/dev/sda1)

\& |
\& +\-\- /var   (/dev/vg_os/lv_var)
.Ve
.PP
(або літери дисків у Windows).
.PP
The \s-1API\s0 first of all sees the disk image at the \*(L"pile of filesystems\*(R"
level.  But it also has a way to inspect the disk image to see if it
contains an operating system, and how the disks are mounted when the
operating system boots: \*(L"\s-1INSPECTION\s0\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3).
.PP
Users expect some tools (like \fIvirt\-cat\fR\|(1)) to work with \s-1VM\s0 paths:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-cat fedora.img /var/log/messages
.Ve
.PP
How does virt-cat know that \f(CW\*(C`/var\*(C'\fR is a separate partition? The trick is
that virt-cat performs inspection on the disk image, and uses that to
translate the path correctly.
.PP
Some tools (including \fIvirt\-cat\fR\|(1), \fIvirt\-edit\fR\|(1), \fIvirt\-ls\fR\|(1))  use
inspection to map \s-1VM\s0 paths.  Other tools, such as \fIvirt\-df\fR\|(1) and
\&\fIvirt\-filesystems\fR\|(1) operate entirely at the raw \*(L"big pile of filesystems\*(R"
level of the libguestfs \s-1API\s0, and don't use inspection.
.PP
\&\fIguestfish\fR\|(1) is in an interesting middle ground.  If you use the \fI\-a\fR
and \fI\-m\fR command line options, then you have to tell guestfish exactly how
to add disk images and where to mount partitions. This is the raw \s-1API\s0 level.
.PP
If you use the \fI\-i\fR option, libguestfs performs inspection and mounts the
filesystems for you.
.PP
The error \f(CW\*(C`no root device found in this operating system image\*(C'\fR is related
to this.  It means inspection was unable to locate an operating system
within the disk image you gave it.  You might see this from programs like
virt-cat if you try to run them on something which is just a disk image, not
a virtual machine disk image.
