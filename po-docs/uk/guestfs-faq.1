.SS "What is libguestfs?"
.IX Subsection "What is libguestfs?"
libguestfs is a way to create, access and modify disk images.  You can look
inside disk images, modify the files they contain, create them from scratch,
resize them, and much more.  It's especially useful from scripts and
programs and from the command line.
.PP
libguestfs is a C library (hence \*(L"lib\-\*(R"), and a set of tools built on this
library, and a set of bindings in many different programming languages.
.PP
For more information about what libguestfs can do read the introduction on
the home page (http://libguestfs.org).
.SS "What are the virt tools?"
.IX Subsection "What are the virt tools?"
Virt tools (website: http://virt\-tools.org) are a whole set of
virtualization management tools aimed at system administrators.  Some of
them come from libguestfs, some from libvirt and many others from other open
source projects.  So virt tools is a superset of libguestfs.  However
libguestfs comes with many important tools.  See http://libguestfs.org
for a full list.

.IX Subsection "Чи потрібно встановлювати пакунки { libvirt / KVM / Red Hat / Fedora } для роботи з libguestfs?"
Ні!
.PP
libvirt не є обов’язковою частиною libguestfs.
.PP
libguestfs works with any disk image, including ones created in VMware, \s-1KVM\s0,
qemu, VirtualBox, Xen, and many other hypervisors, and ones which you have
created from scratch.
.PP
Red Hat sponsors (ie. pays for) development of libguestfs and a huge number
of other open source projects.  But you can run libguestfs and the virt
tools on many different Linux distros and Mac \s-1OS\s0 X.  Some virt tools have
been ported to Windows.

.IP "\fIпорівняно з kpartx\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з kpartx"
Libguestfs takes a different approach from kpartx.  kpartx needs root, and
mounts filesystems on the host kernel (which can be insecure \- see
\&\*(L"\s-1SECURITY\s0\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3)).  Libguestfs isolates your host kernel from guests,
is more flexible, scriptable, supports \s-1LVM\s0, doesn't require root, is
isolated from other processes, and cleans up after itself.  Libguestfs is
more than just file access because you can use it to create images from
scratch.
.IP "\fIпорівняно з vdfuse\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з vdfuse"
vdfuse is like kpartx but for VirtualBox images.  See the kpartx comparison
above.  You can use libguestfs on the partition files exposed by vdfuse,
although it's not necessary since libguestfs can access VirtualBox images
directly.
.IP "\fIпорівняно з qemu-nbd\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з qemu-nbd"
nbd is like kpartx but for qcow2 images.  See the kpartx comparison above.
You can use libguestfs and qemu-nbd together for access to block devices
over the network.
.IP "\fIпорівняно з монтуванням файлових систем у основній системі\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з монтуванням файлових систем у основній системі"
Mounting guest filesystems in the host is insecure and should be avoided
completely for untrusted guests.  Use libguestfs to provide a layer of
protection against filesystem exploits.  See also \fIguestmount\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fIпорівняно з parted\fR" 4
.IX Item "порівняно з parted"
Libguestfs supports \s-1LVM\s0.  Libguestfs uses parted and provides most parted
features through the libguestfs \s-1API\s0.

.SS "Non-ASCII characters don't appear on \s-1VFAT\s0 filesystems."
.IX Subsection "Non-ASCII characters don't appear on VFAT filesystems."
Typical symptoms of this problem:
.IP "\(bu" 4
You get an error when you create a file where the filename contains
non-ASCII characters, particularly non 8\-bit characters from Asian languages
(Chinese, Japanese, etc).  The filesystem is \s-1VFAT\s0.
.IP "\(bu" 4
When you list a directory from a \s-1VFAT\s0 filesystem, filenames appear as
question marks.
.PP
This is a design flaw of the GNU/Linux system.
.PP
\&\s-1VFAT\s0 stores long filenames as \s-1UTF\-16\s0 characters.  When opening or returning
filenames, the Linux kernel has to translate these to some form of 8 bit
string.  \s-1UTF\-8\s0 would be the obvious choice, except for Linux users who
persist in using non\-UTF\-8 locales (the user's locale is not known to the
kernel because it's a function of libc).
.PP
Therefore you have to tell the kernel what translation you want done when
you mount the filesystem.  The two methods are the \f(CW\*(C`iocharset\*(C'\fR parameter
(which is not relevant to libguestfs) and the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag.
.PP
So to use a \s-1VFAT\s0 filesystem you must add the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR flag when mounting.
From guestfish, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ><fs> mount\-options utf8 /dev/sda1 /
.Ve
.PP
or on the guestfish command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& guestfish [...] \-m /dev/sda1:/:utf8
.Ve
.PP
or from the \s-1API:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\& guestfs_mount_options (g, "utf8", "/dev/sda1", "/");
.Ve
.PP
The kernel will then translate filenames to and from \s-1UTF\-8\s0 strings.
.PP
We considered adding this mount option transparently, but unfortunately
there are several problems with doing that:
.IP "\(bu" 4
On some Linux systems, the \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR mount option doesn't work.  We don't
precisely understand what systems or why, but this was reliably reported by
one user.
.IP "\(bu" 4
It would prevent you from using the \f(CW\*(C`iocharset\*(C'\fR parameter because it is
incompatible with \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR.  It is probably not a good idea to use this
parameter, but we don't want to prevent it.
.SS "Non-ASCII characters appear as underscore (_) on \s-1ISO9660\s0 filesystems."
.IX Subsection "Non-ASCII characters appear as underscore (_) on ISO9660 filesystems."
The filesystem was not prepared correctly with mkisofs or genisoimage.  Make
sure the filesystem was created using Joliet and/or Rock Ridge extensions.
libguestfs does not require any special mount options to handle the
filesystem.

You'll have to compile from source, and port it.
.SS "How can I compile and install libguestfs from source?"
.IX Subsection "How can I compile and install libguestfs from source?"
If your Linux distro has a working port of febootstrap (that is, Fedora, Red
Hat Enterprise Linux >= 6.3, Debian, Ubuntu and ArchLinux)  then you should
just be able to compile from source in the usual way.  Download the latest
tarball from http://libguestfs.org/download, unpack it, and start by
reading the \s-1README\s0 file.
.PP
If you \fIdon't\fR have febootstrap, you will need to use the \*(L"fixed appliance
method\*(R".  See: http://libguestfs.org/download/binaries/appliance/
.PP
Patches to port febootstrap to more Linux distros are welcome.
.SS "Why do I get an error when I try to rebuild from the source RPMs supplied by Red Hat / Fedora?"
.IX Subsection "Why do I get an error when I try to rebuild from the source RPMs supplied by Red Hat / Fedora?"
Because of the complexity of building the libguestfs appliance, the source
RPMs provided cannot be rebuilt directly using \f(CW\*(C`rpmbuild\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mock\*(C'\fR.
.PP
If you use Koji (which is open source software and may be installed
locally), then the SRPMs can be rebuilt in Koji.
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji
.PP
If you don't have or want to use Koji, then you have to give libguestfs
access to the network so it can download the RPMs for building the
appliance.  You also need to set an \s-1RPM\s0 macro to tell libguestfs to use the
network.  Put the following line into a file called \f(CW\*(C`$HOME/.rpmmacros\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& %libguestfs_buildnet   1

A very good place to start with Squid configuration is here:

Make sure Squid is running, and that the environment variables

.SS "Upload or write seem very slow."
.IX Subsection "Upload or write seem very slow."
In libguestfs < 1.13.16, the mount command (\*(L"guestfs_mount\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3))
enabled option \f(CW\*(C`\-o sync\*(C'\fR implicitly.  This causes very poor write
performance, and was one of the main gotchas for new libguestfs users.
.PP
For libguestfs < 1.13.16, replace mount with \f(CW\*(C`mount\-options\*(C'\fR, leaving
the first parameter as an empty string.
.PP
You can also do this with more recent versions of libguestfs, but if you
know that you are using libguestfs ≥ 1.13.16 then it's safe to use plain
mount.
.PP
If the underlying disk is not fully allocated (eg. sparse raw or qcow2) then
writes can be slow because the host operating system has to do costly disk
allocations while you are writing. The solution is to use a fully allocated
format instead, ie. non-sparse raw, or qcow2 with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`preallocation=metadata\*(C'\fR option.

.SS "Why don't you do everything through the \s-1FUSE\s0 / filesystem interface?"
.IX Subsection "Why don't you do everything through the FUSE / filesystem interface?"
We offer a command called \fIguestmount\fR\|(1) which lets you mount guest
filesystems on the host.  This is implemented as a \s-1FUSE\s0 module.  Why don't
we just implement the whole of libguestfs using this mechanism, instead of
having the large and rather complicated \s-1API\s0?
.PP
The reasons are twofold.  Firstly, libguestfs offers \s-1API\s0 calls for doing
things like creating and deleting partitions and logical volumes, which
don't fit into a filesystem model very easily.  Or rather, you could fit
them in: for example, creating a partition could be mapped to \f(CW\*(C`mkdir
/fs/hda1\*(C'\fR but then you'd have to specify some method to choose the size of
the partition (maybe \f(CW\*(C`echo 100M > /fs/hda1/.size\*(C'\fR), and the partition
type, start and end sectors etc., but once you've done that the
filesystem-based \s-1API\s0 starts to look more complicated than the call-based \s-1API\s0
we currently have.
.PP
The second reason is for efficiency.  \s-1FUSE\s0 itself is reasonably efficient,
but it does make lots of small, independent calls into the \s-1FUSE\s0 module.  In
guestmount these have to be translated into messages to the libguestfs
appliance which has a big overhead (in time and round trips).  For example,
reading a file in 64 \s-1KB\s0 chunks is inefficient because each chunk would turn
into a single round trip.  In the libguestfs \s-1API\s0 it is much more efficient
to download an entire file or directory through one of the streaming calls
like \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_download\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_tar_out\*(C'\fR.
.SS "Why don't you do everything through \s-1GVFS\s0?"
.IX Subsection "Why don't you do everything through GVFS?"
The problems are similar to the problems with \s-1FUSE\s0.
.PP
\&\s-1GVFS\s0 is a better abstraction than \s-1POSIX/FUSE\s0.  There is an \s-1FTP\s0 backend for
\&\s-1GVFS\s0, which is encouraging because \s-1FTP\s0 is conceptually similar to the
libguestfs \s-1API\s0.  However the \s-1GVFS\s0 \s-1FTP\s0 backend makes multiple simultaneous
connections in order to keep interactivity, which we can't easily do with
libguestfs.

.el .SS "Can I use \f(CWguestfish \-\-ro\fP as a way to backup my virtual machines?"
.IX Subsection "Can I use guestfish --ro as a way to backup my virtual machines?"
Usually this is not a good idea.  The question is answered in more detail in
this mailing list posting:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2010\-August/msg00024.html
.SS "Why can I write to the disk, even though I added it read-only?"
.IX Subsection "Why can I write to the disk, even though I added it read-only?"
.ie n .SS "Why does ""\-\-ro"" appear to have no effect?"
.el .SS "Why does \f(CW\-\-ro\fP appear to have no effect?"
.IX Subsection "Why does --ro appear to have no effect?"
When you add a disk read-only, libguestfs places a writable overlay on top
of the underlying disk.  Writes go into this overlay, and are discarded when
the handle is closed (or \f(CW\*(C`guestfish\*(C'\fR etc. exits).
.PP
There are two reasons for doing it this way: Firstly read-only disks aren't
possible in many cases (eg. \s-1IDE\s0 simply doesn't support them, so you couldn't
have an IDE-emulated read-only disk, although this is not common in real
libguestfs installations).
.PP
Secondly and more importantly, even if read-only disks were possible, you
wouldn't want them.  Mounting any filesystem that has a journal, even
\&\f(CW\*(C`mount \-o ro\*(C'\fR, causes writes to the filesystem because the journal has to
be replayed and metadata updated.  If the disk was truly read-only, you
wouldn't be able to mount a dirty filesystem.
.PP
To make it usable, we create the overlay as a place to temporarily store
these writes, and then we discard it afterwards.  This ensures that the
underlying disk is always untouched.
.PP
Note also that there is a regression test for this when building libguestfs
(in \f(CW\*(C`tests/qemu\*(C'\fR).  This is one reason why it's important for packagers to
run the test suite.
.ie n .SS "Does ""\-\-ro"" make all disks read-only?"
.el .SS "Does \f(CW\-\-ro\fP make all disks read-only?"
.IX Subsection "Does --ro make all disks read-only?"
\&\fINo!\fR The \f(CW\*(C`\-\-ro\*(C'\fR option only affects disks added on the command line,
ie. using \f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR options.
.PP
In guestfish, if you use the \f(CW\*(C`add\*(C'\fR command, then disk is added read-write
(unless you specify the \f(CW\*(C`readonly:true\*(C'\fR flag explicitly with the command).
.SS "What's the difference between guestfish and virt-rescue?"
.IX Subsection "What's the difference between guestfish and virt-rescue?"
A lot of people are confused by the two superficially similar tools we
provide:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& $ guestfish \-\-ro \-a guest.img
\& ><fs> run
\& ><fs> fsck /dev/sda1
\&
\& $ virt\-rescue \-\-ro guest.img
\& ><rescue> /sbin/fsck /dev/sda1
.Ve
.PP
And the related question which then arises is why you can't type in full
shell commands with all the \-\-options in guestfish (but you can in
\&\fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1)).
.PP
\&\fIguestfish\fR\|(1) is a program providing structured access to the
\&\fIguestfs\fR\|(3) \s-1API\s0.  It happens to be a nice interactive shell too, but its
primary purpose is structured access from shell scripts.  Think of it more
like a language binding, like Python and other bindings, but for shell.  The
key differentiating factor of guestfish (and the libguestfs \s-1API\s0 in general)
is the ability to automate changes.
.PP
\&\fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1) is a free-for-all freeform way to boot the libguestfs
appliance and make arbitrary changes to your \s-1VM\s0. It's not structured, you
can't automate it, but for making quick ad-hoc fixes to your guests, it can
be quite useful.
.PP
But, libguestfs also has a \*(L"backdoor\*(R" into the appliance allowing you to
send arbitrary shell commands.  It's not as flexible as virt-rescue, because
you can't interact with the shell commands, but here it is anyway:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ><fs> debug sh "cmd arg1 arg2 ..."
.Ve
.PP
Note that you should \fBnot\fR rely on this.  It could be removed or changed in
future. If your program needs some operation, please add it to the
libguestfs \s-1API\s0 instead.
.ie n .SS "What's the deal with ""guestfish \-i""?"
.el .SS "What's the deal with \f(CWguestfish \-i\fP?"
.IX Subsection "What's the deal with guestfish -i?"
.SS "Why does virt-cat only work on a real \s-1VM\s0 image, but virt-df works on any disk image?"
.IX Subsection "Why does virt-cat only work on a real VM image, but virt-df works on any disk image?"
.ie n .SS "What does ""no root device found in this operating system image"" mean?"
.el .SS "What does ``no root device found in this operating system image'' mean?"
.IX Subsection "What does no root device found in this operating system image mean?"
These questions are all related at a fundamental level which may not be
immediately obvious.
.PP
At the \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) \s-1API\s0 level, a \*(L"disk image\*(R" is just a pile of partitions
and filesystems.
.PP
In contrast, when the virtual machine boots, it mounts those filesystems
into a consistent hierarchy such as:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& /          (/dev/sda2)
\& |
\& +\-\- /boot  (/dev/sda1)
\& |
\& +\-\- /home  (/dev/vg_external/Homes)
\& |
\& +\-\- /usr   (/dev/vg_os/lv_usr)
\& |
\& +\-\- /var   (/dev/vg_os/lv_var)
.Ve
.PP
(or drive letters on Windows).
.PP
The \s-1API\s0 first of all sees the disk image at the \*(L"pile of filesystems\*(R"
level.  But it also has a way to inspect the disk image to see if it
contains an operating system, and how the disks are mounted when the
operating system boots: \*(L"\s-1INSPECTION\s0\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3).
.PP
Users expect some tools (like \fIvirt\-cat\fR\|(1)) to work with \s-1VM\s0 paths:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& virt\-cat fedora.img /var/log/messages
.Ve
.PP
How does virt-cat know that \f(CW\*(C`/var\*(C'\fR is a separate partition? The trick is
that virt-cat performs inspection on the disk image, and uses that to
translate the path correctly.
.PP
Some tools (including \fIvirt\-cat\fR\|(1), \fIvirt\-edit\fR\|(1), \fIvirt\-ls\fR\|(1))  use
inspection to map \s-1VM\s0 paths.  Other tools, such as \fIvirt\-df\fR\|(1) and
\&\fIvirt\-filesystems\fR\|(1) operate entirely at the raw \*(L"big pile of filesystems\*(R"
level of the libguestfs \s-1API\s0, and don't use inspection.
.PP
\&\fIguestfish\fR\|(1) is in an interesting middle ground.  If you use the \fI\-a\fR
and \fI\-m\fR command line options, then you have to tell guestfish exactly how
to add disk images and where to mount partitions. This is the raw \s-1API\s0 level.
.PP
If you use the \fI\-i\fR option, libguestfs performs inspection and mounts the
filesystems for you.
.PP
The error \f(CW\*(C`no root device found in this operating system image\*(C'\fR is related
to this.  It means inspection was unable to locate an operating system
within the disk image you gave it.  You might see this from programs like
virt-cat if you try to run them on something which is just a disk image, not
a virtual machine disk image.
