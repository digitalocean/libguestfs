.SS "\s-1OVERVIEW OF THE SOURCE CODE\s0"
.IX Subsection "OVERVIEW OF THE SOURCE CODE"
Код libguestfs зберігається у сховищі github
https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs
.PP
Large amounts of boilerplate code in libguestfs (\s-1RPC,\s0 bindings,
documentation) are generated.  This means that many source files will appear
to be missing from a straightforward git checkout.  You have to run the
generator (\f(CW\*(C`./autogen.sh && make \-C generator\*(C'\fR) in order to create those
files.
.PP
Libguestfs uses an autotools-based build system, with the main files being
\&\fIconfigure.ac\fR and \fIMakefile.am\fR.  The \fIgenerator\fR subdirectory contains
the generator, plus files describing the \s-1API. \s0 The \fIsrc\fR subdirectory
contains source for the library.  The \fIappliance\fR and \fIdaemon\fR
subdirectories contain the source for the code that builds the appliance,
and the code that runs in the appliance respectively.  Other directories are
covered in the section \*(L"\s-1SOURCE CODE SUBDIRECTORIES\*(R"\s0 below.
.PP
Apart from the fact that all \s-1API\s0 entry points go via some generated code,
the library is straightforward.  (In fact, even the generated code is
designed to be readable, and should be read as ordinary code).  Some actions
run entirely in the library, and are written as C functions in files under
\&\fIsrc\fR.  Others are forwarded to the daemon where (after some generated \s-1RPC\s0
marshalling) they appear as C functions in files under \fIdaemon\fR.
.PP
To build from source, first read the \f(CW\*(C`README\*(C'\fR file.
.SS "\fIlocal*\fP \s-1FILES\s0"
.IX Subsection "local* FILES"
Files in the top source directory that begin with the prefix \fIlocal*\fR are
ignored by git.  These files can contain local configuration or scripts that
you need to build libguestfs.
.PP
By convention, I have a file called \fIlocalconfigure\fR which is a simple
wrapper around \fIautogen.sh\fR containing local configure customizations that
I need:
.PP
.Vb 7
\& . localenv
\& ./autogen.sh \e
\&     \-\-with\-default\-backend=libvirt \e
\&     \-\-enable\-gcc\-warnings \e
\&     \-\-enable\-gtk\-doc \e
\&     \-C \e
\&     "$@"
.Ve
.PP
So I can use this to build libguestfs:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& ./localconfigure && make
.Ve
.PP
If there is a file in the top build directory called \fIlocalenv\fR, then it
will be sourced by \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR.  This file can contain any local environment
variables needed, eg. for skipping tests:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& # Use an alternate python binary.
\& export PYTHON=python3
\& # Skip this test, it is broken.
\& export SKIP_TEST_BTRFS_FSCK=1
.Ve
.PP
Note that \fIlocalenv\fR is included by the top Makefile (so it's a Makefile
fragment).  But if it is also sourced by your \fIlocalconfigure\fR script then
it is used as a shell script.
.SS "\s-1ADDING A NEW API ACTION\s0"
.IX Subsection "ADDING A NEW API ACTION"
Because large amounts of boilerplate code in libguestfs are generated, this
makes it easy to extend the libguestfs \s-1API.\s0
.PP
To add a new \s-1API\s0 action there are two changes:
.IP "1." 4
You need to add a description of the call (name, parameters, return type,
tests, documentation) to \fIgenerator/actions.ml\fR.
.Sp
There are two sorts of \s-1API\s0 action, depending on whether the call goes
through to the daemon in the appliance, or is serviced entirely by the
library (see \*(L"\s-1ARCHITECTURE\*(R"\s0 in \fIguestfs\-internals\fR\|(3)).
\&\*(L"guestfs_sync\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) is an example of the former, since the sync is
done in the appliance.  \*(L"guestfs_set_trace\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) is an example of the
latter, since a trace flag is maintained in the handle and all tracing is
done on the library side.
.Sp
Most new actions are of the first type, and get added to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`daemon_functions\*(C'\fR list.  Each function has a unique procedure number used
in the \s-1RPC\s0 protocol which is assigned to that action when we publish
libguestfs and cannot be reused.  Take the latest procedure number and
increment it.
.Sp
For library-only actions of the second type, add to the
\&\f(CW\*(C`non_daemon_functions\*(C'\fR list.  Since these functions are serviced by the
library and do not travel over the \s-1RPC\s0 mechanism to the daemon, these
functions do not need a procedure number, and so the procedure number is set
to \f(CW\*(C`\-1\*(C'\fR.
.IP "2." 4
Implement the action (in C):
.Sp
For daemon actions, implement the function \f(CW\*(C`do_<name>\*(C'\fR in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`daemon/\*(C'\fR directory.
.Sp
For library actions, implement the function \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_impl_<name>\*(C'\fR
in the \f(CW\*(C`src/\*(C'\fR directory.
.Sp
In either case, use another function as an example of what to do.
.PP
After making these changes, use \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR to compile.
.PP
Note that you don't need to implement the \s-1RPC,\s0 language bindings, manual
pages or anything else.  It's all automatically generated from the OCaml
description.
.SS "\s-1ADDING TESTS FOR AN API ACTION\s0"
.IX Subsection "ADDING TESTS FOR AN API ACTION"
You can supply zero or as many tests as you want per \s-1API\s0 call.  The tests
can either be added as part of the \s-1API\s0 description
(\fIgenerator/actions.ml\fR), or in some rarer cases you may want to drop a
script into \f(CW\*(C`tests/*/\*(C'\fR.  Note that adding a script to \f(CW\*(C`tests/*/\*(C'\fR is
slower, so if possible use the first method.
.PP
The following describes the test environment used when you add an \s-1API\s0 test
in \fIactions.ml\fR.
.PP
The test environment has 4 block devices:
.IP "\fI/dev/sda\fR 500MB" 4
.IX Item "/dev/sda 500MB"
Блоковий пристрій загального типу для тестування.
.IP "\fI/dev/sdb\fR 500MB" 4
.IX Item "/dev/sdb 500MB"
\&\fI/dev/sdb1\fR is an ext2 filesystem used for testing filesystem write
operations.
.IP "\fI/dev/sdc\fR 10MB" 4
.IX Item "/dev/sdc 10MB"
Used in a few tests where two block devices are needed.
.IP "\fI/dev/sdd\fR" 4
.IX Item "/dev/sdd"
\&\s-1ISO\s0 with fixed content (see \fIimages/test.iso\fR).
.PP
To be able to run the tests in a reasonable amount of time, the libguestfs
appliance and block devices are reused between tests.  So don't try testing
\&\*(L"guestfs_kill_subprocess\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) :\-x
.PP
Each test starts with an initial scenario, selected using one of the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Init*\*(C'\fR expressions, described in \fIgenerator/types.ml\fR.  These initialize
the disks mentioned above in a particular way as documented in \fItypes.ml\fR.
You should not assume anything about the previous contents of other disks
that are not initialized.
.PP
You can add a prerequisite clause to any individual test.  This is a
run-time check, which, if it fails, causes the test to be skipped.  Useful
if testing a command which might not work on all variations of libguestfs
builds.  A test that has prerequisite of \f(CW\*(C`Always\*(C'\fR means to run
unconditionally.
.PP
In addition, packagers can skip individual tests by setting environment
variables before running \f(CW\*(C`make check\*(C'\fR.
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SKIP_TEST_<CMD>_<NUM>=1
.Ve
.PP
eg: \f(CW\*(C`SKIP_TEST_COMMAND_3=1\*(C'\fR skips test #3 of \*(L"guestfs_command\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3).
.PP
або:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& SKIP_TEST_<CMD>=1
.Ve
.PP
eg: \f(CW\*(C`SKIP_TEST_ZEROFREE=1\*(C'\fR skips all \*(L"guestfs_zerofree\*(R" in \fIguestfs\fR\|(3) tests.
.PP
Packagers can run only certain tests by setting for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& TEST_ONLY="vfs_type zerofree"
.Ve
.PP
See \fItests/c\-api/tests.c\fR for more details of how these environment
variables work.
.SS "ДІАГНОСТИКА НОВИХ ДІЙ \s-1API\s0"
.IX Subsection "ДІАГНОСТИКА НОВИХ ДІЙ API"
Test new actions work before submitting them.
.PP
You can use guestfish to try out new commands.
.PP
Debugging the daemon is a problem because it runs inside a minimal
environment.  However you can fprintf messages in the daemon to stderr, and
they will show up if you use \f(CW\*(C`guestfish \-v\*(C'\fR.
.SS "ДОДАВАННЯ НОВОЇ ПРИВ’ЯЗКИ ДО МОВИ"
.IX Subsection "ДОДАВАННЯ НОВОЇ ПРИВ’ЯЗКИ ДО МОВИ"
All language bindings must be generated by the generator (see the
\&\fIgenerator\fR subdirectory).
.PP
There is no documentation for this yet.  We suggest you look at an existing
binding, eg. \fIgenerator/ocaml.ml\fR or \fIgenerator/perl.ml\fR.
.SS "\s-1ADDING TESTS FOR LANGUAGE BINDINGS\s0"
.IX Subsection "ADDING TESTS FOR LANGUAGE BINDINGS"
Language bindings should come with tests.  Previously testing of language
bindings was rather ad-hoc, but we have been trying to formalize the set of
tests that every language binding should use.
.PP
Currently only the OCaml and Perl bindings actually implement the full set
of tests, and the OCaml bindings are canonical, so you should emulate what
the OCaml tests do.
.PP
This is the numbering scheme used by the tests:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& \- 000+ basic tests:
\& 
\&   010  load the library
\&   020  create
\&   030  create\-flags
\&   040  create multiple handles
\&   050  test setting and getting config properties
\&   060  explicit close
\&   065  implicit close (in GC\*(Aqd languages)
\&   070  optargs
\& 
\& \- 100  launch, create partitions and LVs and filesystems
\& 
\& \- 400+ events:
\& 
\&   410  close event
\&   420  log messages
\&   430  progress messages
\& 
\& \- 800+ regression tests (specific to the language)
\& 
\& \- 900+ any other custom tests for the language
.Ve
.PP
To save time when running the tests, only 100, 430, 800+, 900+ should launch
the handle.
.SS "\s-1FORMATTING CODE\s0"
.IX Subsection "FORMATTING CODE"
Our C source code generally adheres to some basic code-formatting
conventions.  The existing code base is not totally consistent on this
front, but we do prefer that contributed code be formatted similarly.  In
short, use spaces-not-TABs for indentation, use 2 spaces for each
indentation level, and other than that, follow the K&R style.
.PP
If you use Emacs, add the following to one of one of your start-up files
(e.g., ~/.emacs), to help ensure that you get indentation right:
.PP
.Vb 9
\& ;;; In libguestfs, indent with spaces everywhere (not TABs).
\& ;;; Exceptions: Makefile and ChangeLog modes.
\& (add\-hook \*(Aqfind\-file\-hook
\&     \*(Aq(lambda () (if (and buffer\-file\-name
\&                          (string\-match "/libguestfs\e\e>"
\&                              (buffer\-file\-name))
\&                          (not (string\-equal mode\-name "Change Log"))
\&                          (not (string\-equal mode\-name "Makefile")))
\&                     (setq indent\-tabs\-mode nil))))
\& 
\& ;;; When editing C sources in libguestfs, use this style.
\& (defun libguestfs\-c\-mode ()
\&   "C mode with adjusted defaults for use with libguestfs."
\&   (interactive)
\&   (c\-set\-style "K&R")
\&   (setq c\-indent\-level 2)

\& (add\-hook \*(Aqc\-mode\-hook
