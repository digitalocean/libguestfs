.IP "4. Create output disk" 4
.IX Item "4. Create output disk"
Virt-resize cannot do in-place disk modifications.  You have to have space
to store the resized output disk.
.Sp
To store the resized disk image in a file, create a file of a suitable size:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& # rm \-f outdisk
\& # truncate \-s 10G outdisk
.Ve
.Sp
Or use \fIlvcreate\fR\|(1) to create a logical volume:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& # lvcreate \-L 10G \-n lv_name vg_name
.Ve
.Sp
Or use \fIvirsh\fR\|(1) vol-create-as to create a libvirt storage volume:

.Ve
.IP "5. Зміна розміру" 4
.IX Item "5. Зміна розміру"
virt-resize takes two mandatory parameters, the input disk (eg. device or
file) and the output disk.  The output disk is the one created in the
previous step.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& # virt\-resize indisk outdisk
.Ve
.Sp
This command just copies disk image \f(CW\*(C`indisk\*(C'\fR to disk image \f(CW\*(C`outdisk\*(C'\fR
\&\fIwithout\fR resizing or changing any existing partitions.  If \f(CW\*(C`outdisk\*(C'\fR is
larger, then an extra, empty partition is created at the end of the disk
covering the extra space.  If \f(CW\*(C`outdisk\*(C'\fR is smaller, then it will give an
error.
.Sp
More realistically you'd want to expand existing partitions in the disk
image by passing extra options (for the full list see the \*(L"\s-1OPTIONS\s0\*(R"
section below).
.Sp
\&\*(L"\-\-expand\*(R" is the most useful option.  It expands the named partition
within the disk to fill any extra space:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& # virt\-resize \-\-expand /dev/sda2 indisk outdisk
.Ve
.Sp
(In this case, an extra partition is \fInot\fR created at the end of the disk,
because there will be no unused space).
.Sp
\&\*(L"\-\-resize\*(R" is the other commonly used option.  The following would
increase the size of /dev/sda1 by 200M, and expand /dev/sda2 to fill the
rest of the available space:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\& # virt\-resize \-\-resize /dev/sda1=+200M \-\-expand /dev/sda2 \e
\&     indisk outdisk
.Ve
.Sp
If the expanded partition in the image contains a filesystem or \s-1LVM\s0 \s-1PV\s0, then
if virt-resize knows how, it will resize the contents, the equivalent of
calling a command such as \fIpvresize\fR\|(8), \fIresize2fs\fR\|(8), \fIntfsresize\fR\|(8)
or \fIbtrfs\fR\|(8).  However virt-resize does not know how to resize some
filesystems, so you would have to online resize them after booting the
guest.
.Sp
Other options are covered below.
.IP "6. Перевірка" 4
.IX Item "6. Перевірка"
Thoroughly test the new disk image \fIbefore\fR discarding the old one.
.Sp
If you are using libvirt, edit the \s-1XML\s0 to point at the new disk:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& # virsh edit guestname
.Ve
.Sp
Change <source ...>, see
<http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsDisks>
.Sp
Then start up the domain with the new, resized disk:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& # virsh start guestname
.Ve
.Sp
and check that it still works.  See also the \*(L"\s-1NOTES\s0\*(R" section below for
additional information.
.IP "7. Resize LVs etc inside the guest" 4
.IX Item "7. Resize LVs etc inside the guest"
(This can also be done offline using \fIguestfish\fR\|(1))
.Sp
Once the guest has booted you should see the new space available, at least
for filesystems that virt-resize knows how to resize, and for PVs.  The user
may need to resize LVs inside PVs, and also resize filesystem types that
virt-resize does not know how to expand.
.SS "\s-1SHRINKING\s0 A \s-1VIRTUAL\s0 \s-1MACHINE\s0 \s-1DISK\s0"
.IX Subsection "SHRINKING A VIRTUAL MACHINE DISK"
Shrinking is somewhat more complex than expanding, and only an overview is
given here.
.PP
Firstly virt-resize will not attempt to shrink any partition content (PVs,
filesystems).  The user has to shrink content before passing the disk image
to virt-resize, and virt-resize will check that the content has been shrunk
properly.
.PP
(Shrinking can also be done offline using \fIguestfish\fR\|(1))
.PP
After shrinking PVs and filesystems, shut down the guest, and proceed with
steps 3 and 4 above to allocate a new disk image.
.PP
Then run virt-resize with any of the \fI\-\-shrink\fR and/or \fI\-\-resize\fR options.
.SS "\s-1IGNORING\s0 \s-1OR\s0 \s-1DELETING\s0 \s-1PARTITIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "IGNORING OR DELETING PARTITIONS"
virt-resize also gives a convenient way to ignore or delete partitions when
copying from the input disk to the output disk.  Ignoring a partition speeds
up the copy where you don't care about the existing contents of a
partition.  Deleting a partition removes it completely, but note that it
also renumbers any partitions after the one which is deleted, which can
leave some guests unbootable.
.SS "\s-1QCOW2\s0 \s-1AND\s0 NON-SPARSE \s-1RAW\s0 \s-1FORMATS\s0"
.IX Subsection "QCOW2 AND NON-SPARSE RAW FORMATS"
If the input disk is in qcow2 format, then you may prefer that the output is
in qcow2 format as well.  Alternately, virt-resize can convert the format on
the fly.  The output format is simply determined by the format of the empty
output container that you provide.  Thus to create qcow2 output, use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& qemu\-img create [\-c] \-f qcow2 outdisk [size]
.Ve
.PP
instead of the truncate command (use \fI\-c\fR for a compressed disk).
.PP
Similarly, to get non-sparse raw output use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& fallocate \-l size outdisk
.Ve
.PP
(on older systems that don't have the \fIfallocate\fR\|(1) command use \f(CW\*(C`dd
if=/dev/zero of=outdisk bs=1M count=..\*(C'\fR)
.SS "\s-1LOGICAL\s0 \s-1PARTITIONS\s0"
.IX Subsection "LOGICAL PARTITIONS"
Logical partitions (a.k.a. \f(CW\*(C`/dev/sda5+\*(C'\fR on disks using \s-1DOS\s0 partition
tables) cannot be resized.
.PP
To understand what is going on, firstly one of the four partitions
\&\f(CW\*(C`/dev/sda1\-4\*(C'\fR will have \s-1MBR\s0 partition type \f(CW05\fR or \f(CW\*(C`0f\*(C'\fR.  This is called
the \fBextended partition\fR.  Use \fIvirt\-filesystems\fR\|(1) to see the \s-1MBR\s0
partition type.
.PP
Logical partitions live inside the extended partition.
.PP
The extended partition can be expanded, but not shrunk (unless you force it,
which is not advisable).  When the extended partition is copied across, all
the logical partitions contained inside are copied over implicitly.
Virt-resize does not look inside the extended partition, so it copies the
logical partitions blindly.
.PP
You cannot specify a logical partition (\f(CW\*(C`/dev/sda5+\*(C'\fR) at all on the command
line.  Doing so will give an error.

bootloader automatically, and at the moment that can only be done for
Windows guests.

\&\fI\-\-align\-first never\fR means we never move the first partition.  This is the
safest option.  Try this if the guest does not boot after resizing.
.Sp
\&\fI\-\-align\-first always\fR means we always align the first partition (if it
needs to be aligned).  For some guests this will break the bootloader,

Set the alignment of partitions to \f(CW\*(C`N\*(C'\fR sectors.  The default in virt-resize
< 1.13.19 was 64 sectors, and after that is 128 sectors.

Assuming 512 byte sector size inside the guest, here are some suitable
values for this:
.RS 4
.IP "\fI\-\-alignment 1\fR (512 bytes)" 4
.IX Item "--alignment 1 (512 bytes)"
The partitions would be packed together as closely as possible, but would be

See \fIvirt\-alignment\-scan\fR\|(1) for further details.
.IP "\fI\-\-alignment 8\fR (4K)" 4

original disk image is left intact.
.Sp
Note that when you delete a partition, then anything contained in the

.IP "\fB\-\-expand розділ\fR" 4
.IX Item "--expand розділ"
Expand the named partition so it uses up all extra space (space left over
after any other resize changes that you request have been done).
.Sp
If virt-resize knows how, it will expand the direct content of the
partition.  For example, if the partition is an \s-1LVM\s0 \s-1PV\s0, it will expand the
\&\s-1PV\s0 to fit (like calling \fIpvresize\fR\|(8)).  Virt-resize leaves any other
content it doesn't know about alone.

The filesystem must have been shut down consistently last time it was used.

.IP "\fB\-\-LV\-expand логічний_том\fR" 4
.IX Item "--LV-expand логічний_том"
This takes the logical volume and, as a final step, expands it to fill all

guest with a single \s-1PV\s0 \f(CW\*(C`/dev/sda2\*(C'\fR and a root device called

.Sp
.Vb 2

.Sp
This would first expand the partition (and \s-1PV\s0), and then expand the root
device to fill the extra space in the \s-1PV\s0.
.Sp
The contents of the \s-1LV\s0 are also resized if virt-resize knows how to do
that.  You can stop virt-resize from trying to expand the content by using

online tools).  Virt-resize will check this and give an error if it has not
been done.
.Sp
The amount by which the overall disk must be shrunk (after carrying out all
other operations requested by the user) is called the \*(L"deficit\*(R".  For
example, a straight copy (assume no other operations)  from a 5GB disk image
to a 4GB disk image results in a 1GB deficit.  In this case, virt-resize
would give an error unless the user specified a partition to shrink and that
partition had more than a gigabyte of free space.
.Sp
Note that you cannot use \fI\-\-expand\fR and \fI\-\-shrink\fR together.

.SH "MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT"
.IX Header "MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT"
The \fI\-\-machine\-readable\fR option can be used to make the output more machine
friendly, which is useful when calling virt-resize from other programs, GUIs
etc.
.PP
There are two ways to use this option.
.PP
Firstly use the option on its own to query the capabilities of the
virt-resize binary.  Typical output looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& $ virt\-resize \-\-machine\-readable
\& virt\-resize
\& ntfsresize\-force
\& 32bitok
\& ntfs
\& btrfs
.Ve
.PP
A list of features is printed, one per line, and the program exits with
status 0.
.PP
Secondly use the option in conjunction with other options to make the
regular program output more machine friendly.
.PP
At the moment this means:
.IP "1." 4
Progress bar messages can be parsed from stdout by looking for this regular
expression:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& ^[0\-9]+/[0\-9]+$
.Ve
.IP "2." 4
The calling program should treat messages sent to stdout (except for
progress bar messages) as status messages.  They can be logged and/or
displayed to the user.
.IP "3." 4
The calling program should treat messages sent to stderr as error messages.
In addition, virt-resize exits with a non-zero status code if there was a
fatal error.
.PP
Versions of the program prior to 1.13.9 did not support the
\&\fI\-\-machine\-readable\fR option and will return an error.

.IX Subsection "Partition 1 does not end on cylinder boundary."
Virt-resize aligns partitions to multiples of 128 sectors (see the
\&\fI\-\-alignment\fR parameter).  Usually this means the partitions will not be
aligned to the ancient \s-1CHS\s0 geometry.  However \s-1CHS\s0 geometry is meaningless
for disks manufactured since the early 1990s, and doubly so for virtual hard
drives.  Alignment of partitions to cylinders is not required by any modern
operating system.
.SS "\s-1RESIZING\s0 \s-1WINDOWS\s0 \s-1VIRTUAL\s0 \s-1MACHINES\s0"
.IX Subsection "RESIZING WINDOWS VIRTUAL MACHINES"
In Windows Vista and later versions, Microsoft switched to using a separate
boot partition.  In these VMs, typically \f(CW\*(C`/dev/sda1\*(C'\fR is the boot partition
and \f(CW\*(C`/dev/sda2\*(C'\fR is the main (C:) drive.  Resizing the first (boot)
partition causes the bootloader to fail with \f(CW0xC0000225\fR error.  Resizing
the second partition (ie. C: drive)  should work.
.PP
Windows may initiate a lengthy \*(L"chkdsk\*(R" on first boot after a resize, if
\&\s-1NTFS\s0 partitions have been expanded.  This is just a safety check and (unless
it find errors) is nothing to worry about.
.ie n .SS "\s-1GUEST\s0 \s-1BOOT\s0 \s-1STUCK\s0 \s-1AT\s0 ""\s-1GRUB\s0"""
.el .SS "\s-1GUEST\s0 \s-1BOOT\s0 \s-1STUCK\s0 \s-1AT\s0 ``\s-1GRUB\s0''"
.IX Subsection "GUEST BOOT STUCK AT GRUB"
If a Linux guest does not boot after resizing, and the boot is stuck after
printing \f(CW\*(C`GRUB\*(C'\fR on the console, try reinstalling grub.
.PP
.Vb 6
\& guestfish \-i \-a newdisk
\& ><fs> cat /boot/grub/device.map
\& # check the contents of this file are sensible or
\& # edit the file if necessary
\& ><fs> grub\-install / /dev/vda
\& ><fs> exit
.Ve
.PP
For more flexible guest reconfiguration, including if you need to specify
other parameters to grub-install, use \fIvirt\-rescue\fR\|(1).
.SH "ALTERNATIVE TOOLS"
.IX Header "ALTERNATIVE TOOLS"
There are several proprietary tools for resizing partitions.  We won't
mention any here.
.PP
\&\fIparted\fR\|(8) and its graphical shell gparted can do some types of resizing
operations on disk images.  They can resize and move partitions, but I don't
think they can do anything with the contents, and they certainly don't
understand \s-1LVM\s0.
.PP
\&\fIguestfish\fR\|(1) can do everything that virt-resize can do and a lot more,
but at a much lower level.  You will probably end up hand-calculating sector
offsets, which is something that virt-resize was designed to avoid.  If you
want to see the guestfish-equivalent commands that virt-resize runs, use the
\&\fI\-\-debug\fR flag.
.SH "SHELL QUOTING"
.IX Header "SHELL QUOTING"
Libvirt guest names can contain arbitrary characters, some of which have
meaning to the shell such as \f(CW\*(C`#\*(C'\fR and space.  You may need to quote or
escape these characters on the command line.  See the shell manual page
\&\fIsh\fR\|(1) for details.
