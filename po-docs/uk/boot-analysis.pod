boot-analysis — трасування і аналіз процесу завантаження базової системи

=head1 КОРОТКИЙ ОПИС

 ./run utils/boot-analysis/boot-analysis

=head1 ОПИС

Trace and analyze the appliance boot process to find out which steps are
taking the most time.  It is not part of the standard tests.

This needs to be run on a quiet machine, so that other processes disturb the
timing as little as possible.  The program is completely safe to run at any
time.  It doesn't read or write any external files, and it doesn't require
root.

You can run it from the build directory on the built copy of libguestfs like
this:

 make
 ./run utils/boot-analysis/boot-analysis

If you omit C<./run> then it is run on the installed copy of libguestfs.

=head2 Як це працює

We create a libguestfs handle and register callback handlers so we can see
appliance messages, trace events and so on.

We then launch the handle and shut it down as quickly as possible.

While the handle is running, events (seen by the callback handlers)  are
written verbatim into an in-memory buffer, with timestamps.

Afterwards we analyze the result using regular expressions to try to
identify a "timeline" for the handle (eg. at what time did the BIOS hand
control to the kernel).  This analysis is done in
F<utils/boot-analysis/boot-analysis-timeline.c>.

The whole process is repeated across a few runs, and the final timeline
(including statistical analysis of the variation between runs) gets printed.

The program is very sensitive to the specific messages printed by
BIOS/kernel/supermin/userspace.  It only works on x86-64 or aarch64.  It
will require periodic adjustment of the regular expressions in order to keep
things up to date.
