# Setting debug or trace isn't very useful because the PHP test script
# mixes stdout and stderr together and compares this to the expected
# output, so you'd just get failures for every test.  So there is no
# good way to debug libguestfs failures in PHP tests, but if an
# individual test fails locally then you can edit the
# guestfs_php_*.phpt.in and uncomment the putenv statement, then look
# at the output.
