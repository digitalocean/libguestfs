(* Convert a non-canonical LV path like /dev/mapper/vg-lv or /dev/dm-0
 * to a canonical one.
 *
 * This is harder than it should be.  A LV device like /dev/VG/LV is
 * really a symlink to a device-mapper device like /dev/dm-0.  However
 * at the device-mapper (kernel) level, nothing is really known about
 * LVM (a userspace concept).  Therefore we use a convoluted method to
 * determine this, by listing out known LVs and checking whether the
 * rdev (major/minor) of the device we are passed matches any of them.
 *
 * Note use of 'stat' instead of 'lstat' so that symlinks are fully
 * resolved.
