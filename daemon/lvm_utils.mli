val lv_canonical : string -> string option
(** Convert a non-canonical LV path like /dev/mapper/vg-lv or /dev/dm-0
    to a canonical one.

    On error this raises an exception.  There are two possible non-error
    return cases:

    Some lv = conversion was successful, returning the canonical LV
    None = input path was not an LV, it could not be made canonical *)
