Tasks required before the GObject bindings can be considered complete:

* Fix the problem of inspect_get_type
  - This is addressed here: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=671218
    The fix will hopefully make it upstream soon. No changes are required in
    libguestfs.
* Bind the libguestfs events API

Tasks which would improve the usability of the GObject bindings:

* Implement _async versions of all apis
