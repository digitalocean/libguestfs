This directory contains various example programs which use the
libguestfs API.

As they are examples, these are licensed so they can be freely copied
and used without any restrictions.

Tips:

(1) To enable verbose messages, set environment variable
LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=1

(2) If you haven't installed libguestfs, run the examples like this:
LIBGUESTFS_PATH=appliance examples/to-xml
(the path should point to the directory containing vmlinuz.* and
initramfs.* files).
