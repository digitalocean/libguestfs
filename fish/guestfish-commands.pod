=head2 alloc

=head2 allocate

 alloc filename size

This creates an empty (zeroed) file of the given size, and then adds
so it can be further examined.

For more advanced image creation, see L</disk-create>.

Size can be specified using standard suffixes, eg. C<1M>.

To create a sparse file, use L</sparse> instead.  To create a
prepared disk image, see L</PREPARED DISK IMAGES>.

=head2 copy-in

 copy-in local [local ...] /remotedir

C<copy-in> copies local files or directories recursively into the disk
image, placing them in the directory called F</remotedir> (which must
exist).  This guestfish meta-command turns into a sequence of
L</tar-in> and other commands as necessary.

Multiple local files and directories can be specified, but the last
parameter must always be a remote directory.  Wildcards cannot be
used.

=head2 copy-out

 copy-out remote [remote ...] localdir

C<copy-out> copies remote files or directories recursively out of the
disk image, placing them on the host disk in a local directory called
C<localdir> (which must exist).  This guestfish meta-command turns
into a sequence of L</download>, L</tar-out> and other commands as
necessary.

Multiple remote files and directories can be specified, but the last
parameter must always be a local directory.  To download to the
current directory, use C<.> as in:

 copy-out /home .

Wildcards cannot be used in the ordinary command, but you can use
them with the help of L</glob> like this:

 glob copy-out /home/* .

=head2 delete-event

 delete-event name

Delete the event handler which was previously registered as C<name>.
If multiple event handlers were registered with the same name, they
are all deleted.

See also the guestfish commands C<event> and C<list-events>.

=head2 display

 display filename

Use C<display> (a graphical display program) to display an image
file.  It downloads the file, and runs C<display> on it.

To use an alternative program, set the C<GUESTFISH_DISPLAY_IMAGE>
environment variable.  For example to use the GNOME display program:

 export GUESTFISH_DISPLAY_IMAGE=eog

See also L<display(1)>.

=head2 echo

 echo [params ...]

This echos the parameters to the terminal.

=head2 edit

=head2 vi

=head2 emacs

 edit filename

This is used to edit a file.  It downloads the file, edits it
locally using your editor, then uploads the result.

The editor is C<$EDITOR>.  However if you use the alternate
commands C<vi> or C<emacs> you will get those corresponding
editors.

=head2 event

 event name eventset "shell script ..."

Register a shell script fragment which is executed when an
event is raised.  See L<guestfs(3)/guestfs_set_event_callback>
for a discussion of the event API in libguestfs.

The C<name> parameter is a name that you give to this event
handler.  It can be any string (even the empty string) and is
simply there so you can delete the handler using the guestfish
C<delete-event> command.

The C<eventset> parameter is a comma-separated list of one
or more events, for example C<close> or C<close,trace>.  The
special value C<*> means all events.

The third and final parameter is the shell script fragment
(or any external command) that is executed when any of the
events in the eventset occurs.  It is executed using
C<$SHELL -c>, or if C<$SHELL> is not set then F</bin/sh -c>.

The shell script fragment receives callback parameters as
arguments C<$1>, C<$2> etc.  The actual event that was
called is available in the environment variable C<$EVENT>.

 event "" close "echo closed"
 event messages appliance,library,trace "echo $@"
 event "" progress "echo progress: $3/$4"
 event "" * "echo $EVENT $@"

See also the guestfish commands C<delete-event> and C<list-events>.

=head2 glob

 glob command args...

Expand wildcards in any paths in the args list, and run C<command>
repeatedly on each matching path.

See L</WILDCARDS AND GLOBBING>.

=head2 hexedit

 hexedit <filename|device>
 hexedit <filename|device> <max>
 hexedit <filename|device> <start> <max>

Use hexedit (a hex editor) to edit all or part of a binary file
or block device.

This command works by downloading potentially the whole file or
device, editing it locally, then uploading it.  If the file or
device is large, you have to specify which part you wish to edit
by using C<max> and/or C<start> C<max> parameters.
C<start> and C<max> are specified in bytes, with the usual
modifiers allowed such as C<1M> (1 megabyte).

For example to edit the first few sectors of a disk you
might do:

 hexedit /dev/sda 1M

which would allow you to edit anywhere within the first megabyte
of the disk.

To edit the superblock of an ext2 filesystem on F</dev/sda1>, do:

 hexedit /dev/sda1 0x400 0x400

(assuming the superblock is in the standard location).

This command requires the external L<hexedit(1)> program.  You
can specify another program to use by setting the C<HEXEDITOR>
environment variable.

See also L</hexdump>.

=head2 lcd

 lcd directory

Change the local directory, ie. the current directory of guestfish
itself.

Note that C<!cd> won't do what you might expect.

=head2 list-events

 list-events

List the event handlers registered using the guestfish
C<event> command.

=head2 man

=head2 manual

  man

Opens the manual page for guestfish.

=head2 more

=head2 less

 more filename

 less filename

This is used to view a file.

The default viewer is C<$PAGER>.  However if you use the alternate
command C<less> you will get the C<less> command specifically.

=head2 reopen

  reopen

Close and reopen the libguestfs handle.  It is not necessary to use
this normally, because the handle is closed properly when guestfish
exits.  However this is occasionally useful for testing.

=head2 setenv

  setenv VAR value

Set the environment variable C<VAR> to the string C<value>.

To print the value of an environment variable use a shell command
such as:

 !echo $VAR

=head2 sparse

 sparse filename size

This creates an empty sparse file of the given size, and then adds
so it can be further examined.

In all respects it works the same as the L</alloc> command, except that
the image file is allocated sparsely, which means that disk blocks are
not assigned to the file until they are needed.  Sparse disk files
only use space when written to, but they are slower and there is a
danger you could run out of real disk space during a write operation.

For more advanced image creation, see L</disk-create>.

Size can be specified using standard suffixes, eg. C<1M>.

See also the guestfish L</scratch> command.

=head2 supported

 supported

This command returns a list of the optional groups
known to the daemon, and indicates which ones are
supported by this build of the libguestfs appliance.

See also L<guestfs(3)/AVAILABILITY>.

=head2 time

 time command args...

Run the command as usual, but print the elapsed time afterwards.  This
can be useful for benchmarking operations.

=head2 unsetenv

  unsetenv VAR

Remove C<VAR> from the environment.
