=head2 B<-N disk> - create a blank disk

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]disk[:I<size>]>

Create a blank disk, size 100MB (by default).

The default size can be changed by supplying an optional parameter.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 size          100M          the size of the disk image

=head2 B<-N part> - create a partitioned disk

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]part[:I<size>[:I<partition>]]>

Create a disk with a single partition.  By default the size of the disk
is 100MB (the available space in the partition will be a tiny bit smaller)
and the partition table will be MBR (old DOS-style).

These defaults can be changed by supplying optional parameters.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 size          100M          the size of the disk image
 partition     mbr           partition table type

=head2 B<-N fs> - create a filesystem

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]fs[:I<filesystem>[:I<size>[:I<partition>]]]>

Create a disk with a single partition, with the partition containing
an empty filesystem.  This defaults to creating a 100MB disk (the available
space in the filesystem will be a tiny bit smaller) with an MBR (old
DOS-style) partition table and an ext2 filesystem.

These defaults can be changed by supplying optional parameters.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 filesystem    ext2          the type of filesystem to use
 size          100M          the size of the disk image
 partition     mbr           partition table type

=head2 B<-N lv> - create a disk with logical volume

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]lv[:I<name>[:I<size>[:I<partition>]]]>

Create a disk with a single partition, set up the partition as an
LVM2 physical volume, and place a volume group and logical volume
on there.  This defaults to creating a 100MB disk with the VG and
LV called C</dev/VG/LV>.  You can change the name of the VG and LV
by supplying an alternate name as the first optional parameter.

Note this does not create a filesystem.  Use 'lvfs' to do that.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 name          /dev/VG/LV    the name of the VG and LV to use
 size          100M          the size of the disk image
 partition     mbr           partition table type

=head2 B<-N lvfs> - create a disk with logical volume and filesystem

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]lvfs[:I<name>[:I<filesystem>[:I<size>[:I<partition>]]]]>

Create a disk with a single partition, set up the partition as an
LVM2 physical volume, and place a volume group and logical volume
on there.  Then format the LV with a filesystem.  This defaults to
creating a 100MB disk with the VG and LV called C</dev/VG/LV>, with an
ext2 filesystem.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 name          /dev/VG/LV    the name of the VG and LV to use
 filesystem    ext2          the type of filesystem to use
 size          100M          the size of the disk image
 partition     mbr           partition table type

=head2 B<-N bootroot> - create a boot and root filesystem

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]bootroot[:I<bootfs>[:I<rootfs>[:I<size>[:I<bootsize>[:I<partition>]]]]]>

Create a disk with two partitions, for boot and root filesystem.
Format the two filesystems independently.  There are several optional
parameters which control the exact layout and filesystem types.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 bootfs        ext2          the type of filesystem to use for boot
 rootfs        ext2          the type of filesystem to use for root
 size          100M          the size of the disk image
 bootsize      32M           the size of the boot filesystem
 partition     mbr           partition table type

=head2 B<-N bootrootlv> - create a boot and root filesystem using LVM

C<guestfish -N [I<filename>=]bootrootlv[:I<name>[:I<bootfs>[:I<rootfs>[:I<size>[:I<bootsize>[:I<partition>]]]]]]>

This is the same as C<bootroot> but the root filesystem (only) is
placed on a logical volume, named by default C</dev/VG/LV>.  There are
several optional parameters which control the exact layout.

The optional parameters are:

 Name          Default value
 name          /dev/VG/LV    the name of the VG and LV for root
 bootfs        ext2          the type of filesystem to use for boot
 rootfs        ext2          the type of filesystem to use for root
 size          100M          the size of the disk image
 bootsize      32M           the size of the boot filesystem
 partition     mbr           partition table type
