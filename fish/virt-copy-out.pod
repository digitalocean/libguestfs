=head1 NAME

virt-copy-out - Copy files and directories out of a virtual machine disk image.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-copy-out -a disk.img /file|dir [/file|dir ...] localdir

 virt-copy-out -d domain /file|dir [/file|dir ...] localdir

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<virt-copy-out> copies files and directories out of a virtual machine
disk image or named libvirt domain.

You can give one of more filenames and directories on the command
line.  Directories are copied out recursively.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Download the home directories from a virtual machine:

 mkdir homes
 virt-copy-out -d MyGuest /home homes

=head1 JUST A SHELL SCRIPT WRAPPER AROUND GUESTFISH

This command is just a simple shell script wrapper around the
L<guestfish(1)> C<copy-out> command.  For anything more complex than a
trivial copy, you are probably better off using guestfish directly.

=head1 OPTIONS

Since the shell script just passes options straight to guestfish, read
L<guestfish(1)> to see the full list of options.
