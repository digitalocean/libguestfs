The files augeas-c.c, augeas.ml and augeas.mli come from the
ocaml-augeas library:

  http://git.annexia.org/?p=ocaml-augeas.git

which is released under a compatible license.  We try to keep them
identical, so if you make changes to these files then you must also
submit the changes to ocaml-augeas, and vice versa.
