Description=p2v service
# For the GUI, we cannot necessarily wait for the network to come
# online, since that may require the "Configure Network" dialog.  For
# the command line, we would like the network to be online, but we
# test that within virt-p2v itself.  Therefore use network.target
# here, not network-online.target.
