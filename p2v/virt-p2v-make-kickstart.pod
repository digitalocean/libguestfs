virt-p2v-make-kickstart - Build the virt-p2v kickstart

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 virt-p2v-make-kickstart [-o p2v.ks] [--proxy=http://...] repo [repo...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<virt-p2v(1)> converts a physical machine to run virtualized on KVM,
managed by libvirt, OpenStack, oVirt, Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualisation (RHEV), or one of the other targets supported by
L<virt-v2v(1)>.

Kickstart is a format used by Red Hat-derived distributions (such as
Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and
others) to describe how to make live CDs, install the distro, make
"Spins" and so on.  It is driven by a kickstart file.

virt-p2v-make-kickstart builds a kickstart file which can be used to
build a bootable P2V ISO, live CD, USB key, or PXE image.  This tool
only builds the kickstart file, but this manual page describes some of
the ways you can use the kickstart file.

=head1 BUILDING THE KICKSTART FILE

Using virt-p2v-make-kickstart is very simple:

 virt-p2v-make-kickstart fedora

will build a kickstart file for Fedora.  The kickstart file will be
called C<p2v.ks> and located in the current directory.

The parameters are a list of one or more repositories.  Some built-in
repositories are available: C<fedora>, C<rawhide> or C<koji>.  You can
also use a URL as a parameter to point to a repository.

To control the name of the output file, use the I<-o> parameter.  To
tell kickstart to use a proxy server or web cache to download files,
use the I<--proxy> parameter.

=head1 BUILDING A LIVE CD / ISO

Once you have the kickstart file, you can use L<livecd-creator(8)>
to make a live CD:

 sudo livecd-creator p2v.ks

Before running this note that you should probably run
C<livecd-creator> in a disposable virtual machine for these reasons:

=over 4

=item *

You have to disable SELinux when running the tool.

=item *

This tool has to be run as root, and has some nasty failure modes.

=item *

You can only create the exact same Live CD distro as the host
distro.  Cross-builds will fail in strange ways (eg. RHBZ#1092327).

=head1 BUILDING A FEDORA SPIN USING KOJI

This requires C<spin-livecd> permissions on Koji, which are not given
out usually, even to Fedora packagers.  However assuming you have been
given these permissions (or have your own Koji instance, I guess),
then you can do:

 koji spin-livecd [--scratch] p2v 1.XX.YY rawhide x86_64 p2v.ks

=over 4

=item *

Add the C<--scratch> option to do a scratch build (recommended for
testing).

=item *

C<1.XX.YY> should match the libguestfs version

=item *

Instead of C<rawhide> you can use any Koji target.

=head1 BUILDING BOOTABLE USB KEY

Use the L<livecd-iso-to-disk(8)> program to convert the ISO created
above to a USB key:

 sudo livecd-iso-to-disk livecd-p2v.iso /dev/sdX

=head1 BUILDING A PXE BOOT IMAGE

Use the C<livecd-iso-to-pxeboot> program to convert the ISO created
above to a PXE boot image.

 sudo livecd-iso-to-pxeboot livecd-p2v.iso

This creates a C<tftpboot> subdirectory under the current directory
containing the files required to PXE boot virt-p2v:

 $ ls -1R tftpboot/
 tftpboot/:
 initrd0.img
 pxelinux.0
 pxelinux.cfg/
 vmlinuz0
 
 tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg:
 default

=head1 TESTING THE P2V ISO USING QEMU

You can use qemu to test-boot the P2V ISO:

 qemu-kvm -m 1024 -hda /tmp/guest.img -cdrom /tmp/livecd-p2v.iso -boot d

Note that C<-hda> is the (virtual) system that you want to convert
(for test purposes).  It could be any guest type supported by
L<virt-v2v(1)>, including Windows or Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
